# Bukhari 7

**Chapter 14. Book of the *Adhan***

**I: The origin of the *Adhan***

The words of Allah, *"When you call to the prayer they make a mockery and
a game of it. That is because they are people who do not use their
intellect."* (5:61) and *"When the prayer is called on the day of
Jumu'a."* (62:9)

578. It is related that Anas said, "The people mentioned the fire and the
bell, recollecting the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was instructed
to say the phrases of the *adhan* twice and those of the *iqama*
once only."

579. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "When the Muslims arrived in Madina,
they would gather and guess at the time of the prayer. There was no call
for it. They discussed it one day and some of them said that they should
adopt a bell like that of the Christians and others said that it should be
a trumpet like the horn of the Jews. 'Umar said, 'Why don't you send a man
to call to the prayer?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Bilal, stand up and call to the prayer.'"

**II: The doubling up of the phrases of the *adhan***

580. It is related that Anas said, "Bilal was ordered to repeat the phrases
of the *adhan* twice and to say those of the *iqama* once only
except for the words *'qad qamati's-salat'* ."

581. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When the people increased in
number, they discussed how the time of the prayer could be made known in
a way they would all recognise. They suggested lighting a fire and striking
a bell. However, Bilal was ordered to call the *adhan* repeating its
phrases twice and to call the *iqama* repeating its phrases once only."

**III: Repeating the phrases of the *iqama* once only except for the
words *"qad qamat's-salat*"**

582. It is related that Anas said, "Bilal was ordered to repeat the phrases
of the *adhan* twice and to say those of the *iqama* once only."

Isma'il said, "I mentioned that to Ayyub and he said, 'Except the
*iqama*.'"

**IV: The excellence of the *adhan***

583. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the call to
prayer is done Shaytan retreats, farting so that he will not hear it. When
the call is finished he comes back again until the iqama is done, when he
retreats again. When the *iqama* is finished, he comes back again,
insinuating himself between a man and his self and saying, 'Think of
such-and-such, think of such-and-such,' which he was not thinking about before,
until the man does not know how much he has prayed."

**V: Raising the voice during the call**

'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz said, "Give the *adhan* without elongating it
or making it too ornate or we will dismiss you."

584. It is related that Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said
(to Abu Sa'sa' al Ansari), "I see that you love sheep and the desert. When
you are among your sheep or in the desert, give the call to prayer and raise
your voice when doing it. No jinn or man or anything within range hears the
voice of the *mu'adhdhin* without bearing witness for him on the Day
of Rising." Abu Sa'id said, "I heard this from the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace."

**VI: The *adhan* preventing bloodshed**

585. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, went out with us on a raid against some people,
he would not let us attack until after daybreak but would wait. If he heard
the *adhan*, he refrained from attacking them, but if he did not hear
the *adhan*, he would attack them." He said, "We went out to Khaybar
and arrived there at night. In the morning when he did not hear the
*adhan*, he rode out and I rode behind Abu Talha and my foot was touching
the foot of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
They came out towards us carrying their spades and buckets. When they saw
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they said, 'Muhammad!
By Allah, Muhammad and the army!' When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, saw them, he said, 'Allah is greater! Allah
is greater! Khaybar is destroyed. When we alight in the yard of a people,
it is a bad morning indeed for those who have been warned.' "

**VII: What should be said on hearing the call to prayer**

586. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When
you hear the *adhan*, repeat what the mu'adhdhin says."

587. 'Isa ibn Talha related that one day he heard Mu'awiya repeating the
words of the *adhan* up to the words, 'I testify that Muhammad is the
Messenger of Allah.' "

The same thing is related from Yahya

588. Yahya added, "One of our brothers related that when he said, 'Come to
prayer,' he said, 'There is no strength nor power except by Allah.' He said,
'That is what we heard your Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
saying.'"

**VIII: Supplication during the call**

589. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever says, after hearing
the *adhan*, 'O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and established prayer,
give Muhammad intercession and superiority and raise him up to the praiseworthy
station which You promised him,' my intercession will be available to him
on the Day of Rising."

**IX: Drawing lots to do the *adhan***

It is mentioned that some people disagreed about the *adhan* and Sa'd
had them draw lots among themselves.

[5903). It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "If people
only knew what was in the call to prayer and the first row, and could find
no other way to get it than drawing lots for it, they would draw lots for
it. If they only knew what was in going early to the prayer, they would race
each other to get there. And if they only knew what was in the prayers of
*'Isha'* and *Subh*, they would come to them even if they had to crawl."

**X: Talking during the *adhan***

Sulayman ibn Surad talked during the *adhan*. Al-Hasan said, "There
is no harm in laughing while the *adhan* or the *iqama* is being
given."

591. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith said, "Ibn 'Abbas addressed
us on a wet, muddy day. When the *mu'adhdhin* reached, 'Come to the
prayer,' he ordered him to call, 'Pray in your homes.' The people looked
at one another [in disapproval] so he said, 'One who is better than him did this [i.e. the Prophet did it]. It [Jumu'a] is a duty.' "

**XI: A blind person calling the *adhan* when there is someone to inform
him**

[59216). It is related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah that
his father said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Bilal calls the *adhan* during the night, so eat and
drink until Ibn Umm Maktum calls the *adhan*." Then he said, "He was
a blind man who did not call the *adhan* until someone said to him,
'The morning has come. The morning has come.' "

**XII: The *adhan* after the time of *Fajr***

[59329). It is related from Hafsa that when the
*mu'adhdhin* withdrew to call the *adhan* of *Subh* and daybreak
appeared, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed two short *rak'ats* before the *iqama* of the prayer was
given.

594. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray two short *rak'ats* between the call and
the *iqama* for the *Subh* prayer.

595. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Bilal calls the prayer during
the night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call."

**XIII: The *adhan* before *fajr***

596. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you (or none among you) should
let the *adhan* of Bilal stop you from eating your *sahur*. He
gives the *adhan* (or the call) at night so that any of you who are
praying can finish off and any of you who are sleeping can get up. He is
not saying that it is *fajr* or time for *Subh*." Then he pointed
his fingers upwards and lowered them until he said, "Like that."

Zuhayr [one of the tranmistters] said, "With his two index fingers, one on top of the other and
then opened them out to his right and left." (Indicating the spread of the
light of dawn)

597. From 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "Bilal calls the prayer during the night, so eat and drink until Ibn
Umm Maktum gives the call."

**XIV: The length of time between the *adhan* and the *iqama*
and those who wait for the *iqama***

598. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal al-Muzani that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is a prayer
between the two *adhans*, there is a prayer between the two
*adhans*," and then the third time he said, "For whoever wishes it."

599. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When the *mu'adhdhin* gave
the *adhan*, some of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, would go quickly to the pillars until the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out. In this way they would
pray two *rak'ats* before *Maghrib* even though there was scarcely
any time between the *adhan* and the *iqama*."

Shu'ba said, "There was only a very short time between the two."

**XV: Those who wait for the *iqama***

600. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the voice of the
*mu'adhdhin* had died down after the first call for the *Fajr*
prayer, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
would get up and pray two short *rak'ats* before the *Fajr* prayer
after the dawn had become clear. Then he would lie down on his right side
until the *mu'adhdhin* came to do the *iqama*.

**XVI: There is a prayer between the two *adhans* for any who wish
to do it.**

601. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal al-Muzani said that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is a prayer between
the two *adhans*, there is a prayer between the two *adhans*,"
and then the third time he said, "For whoever wishes it."

**XVII: Saying that only one *mu'adhdhin* should call the prayer on
a journey**

602. It is related from Malik ibn al-Huwayrith, "I came to the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, with some of my people and we stayed
with him for twenty nights. He was kind and merciful to us. When he saw our
yearning for our families, he said, 'Return and be with them. Teach them
and do the prayer. When the time for the prayer comes, one of you should
give the adhan on behalf of all of you and the oldest of you should be the
Imam.' "

**XVIII: The *adhan* and the *iqama* for travellers when there
is a group of them. The same applies at 'Arafa and al-Muzdalifa.**

The *mu'adhdhin* saying on a cold or rainy night, "Pray in your homes."

603. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and the *mu'adhdhin* wanted
to give the *adhan* and the Prophet said to him, 'Let it get cooler.'
Then he wanted to give the adhan and he said to him, 'Let it get cooler.'
Then he wanted to give the *adhan* and he said to him, 'Let it get cooler.'
until the shadows are equal to the hills.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'Intense heat is from the blast of Jahannam.'"

604. It is related that Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said, "Two men came to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanting to travel and the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'When you set out,
give the *adhan* and the *iqama* and then the oldest of you should
be the Imam.' "

605. It is related from Malik, "We came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, as young men of about the same age and stayed twenty
days and nights with him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was kind and merciful to us. When he realised that we were
longing for our families - or yearning for them - he asked us about those
we had left behind us and we informed him. He said, 'Return to your families
and stay with them and teach them and instruct them' - and he mentioned some
things which I remember and some which I do not remember - 'and pray as you
have seen me pray. When it is time for the prayer, one of you should give
the *adhan* on behalf of all of you and the oldest of you should be
the Imam.'"

606. It is related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar
gave the *adhan* at Dajnan on a cold night and then said, 'Pray in your
houses.' He told us that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had ordered the *mu'adhdhin* to give the adhan and
then to say after it, 'Pray in your houses' on a cold or rainy night when
on a journey."

[Dajnan: a mountain one postal stage (barid) from Makka.]

607. It is related from 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa that his father said, "I saw
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at al-Abtah.
Bilal came to him and gave the adhan for the prayer. Then Bilal brought out
a short spear which he stuck upright in front of the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at Al-Abtah and gave the
*iqama* for the prayer."

**XIX: Should the *mu'adhdhin* call this way and that and should he
turn his head during the *adhan*.**

It is mentioned that Bilal put his two fingers in his ears and that Ibn 'Umar
did not put his fingers in his ears. Ibrahim said, "There is no harm in giving
the *adhan* without *wudu'*." 'Ata' said, *"Wudu'* is a duty
and a *sunna*." 'A'isha said, "The Prophe, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to remember Allah at all times."

608. It is related from 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa that his father said that he
saw Bilal giving the *adhan* and he called this way and that during
the *adhan*."

**XX: The words of a man, "We have missed the prayer."**

Ibn Sirin disliked people saying, "We have missed the prayer." People should
rather say, "We have not caught the prayer." The words of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, are sounder.

609. It is related that Abu Qatada said that his father said, "Once while
we were praying with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
he heard some men making a lot of noise while hurrying. After he had finished the prayer,
he said, 'What is going on with you?' They said, 'We were hurrying to the
prayer.' He said, 'Do not do it. When you come to the prayer, you must come
with tranquility. Pray as much as you catch and complete anything you have
missed.'"

**XXI: Do not run to the prayer, but come to it with tranquility and
dignity.**

"Pray as much as you catch and complete anything you have missed." Abu Qatada
said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said it.

610. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When you hear the
*iqama*, go to the prayer and you should be tranquil and dignified.
Do not hurry. Pray as much as you catch and complete anything you have missed."

**XXII: At what point should people get up when they see the Imam during
the *iqama***

611. It is related from Abu Qatada's father that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "When the *iqama* is given, do not get
up until you can see me."

**XXIII: Not standing up for the prayer in a hurried way, but standing with
tranquility and dignity**

612. It is related from Abu Qatada's father that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the *iqama* is
given, do not get up until you can see me. You should do it with tranquility."

**XXIV: Is it permitted to leave the mosque with good reason?**

613. It is related from Abu Hurayra, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, once left after the *iqama* for the prayer
had been given and the rows were straight. He was standing in his prayer
place and we were waiting for him to give the *takbir*. He left, saying,
'Stay where you are.' We remained as we were until he came back to us with
his head dripping water. He had done *ghusl*."

**XXV: When the Imam says, 'Stay where you are,' then wait for him until
he returns.**

614. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The *iqama* for the prayer
had been given and the people had made their rows straight and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out and went forward
but he was junub. Then he said, 'Stay where you are.' He went back and did
*ghusl*. Then he came out with his head dripping water and led them
in prayer."

**XXVI: A man saying, "We have not prayed."**

615. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab came
on the Day of the Ditch after the sun had set and he began to curse the
unbelievers of Quraysh and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I was about to pray
*'Asr* when the sun set. That was after the fasting person had broken
his fast.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'By
Allah, I have not prayed either!' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, went down to Buthan and I went with him. He did *wudu'* and
then prayed *'Asr* after the sun had set and then prayed *Maghrib*
after it."

**XXVII: When the Imam is presented with something that needs to be done
after the *iqama***

616. It is related that Anas said, "The *iqama* for the prayer was given
while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was talking privately
to a man in the corner of the mosque. He did not get up for the prayer until
the people had gone to sleep."

**XXVIII: Talking after the *iqama***

617. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The iqama for the prayer was
given and a man presented himself to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and detained him after the *iqama* for the prayer had
been given."

**Chapter 15: The Group Prayer and
the Imam**

**I: The obligatory nature of the group prayer**

Al-Hasan said, "When someone's mother forbids him to go to the group prayer
of *'Isha'* out of compassion for him he should not obey her."

618. It is related from Abu Hurayra said that
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "By Him
in Whose hand my soul is, I seriously considered ordering someone to collect
firewood, ordering the prayer be called, appointing a man to lead the prayer
and then coming up behind certain men and burning their houses down about
them! By Him in whose hand my soul is, if any of them had known they would
find a meaty bone or two good hooves, they would have attended
*'Isha*'."

**II: The excellence of the group prayer**

When al-Aswad missed the group prayer, he went to another mosque. Anas came
to a mosque where the prayer had been said, did the adhan, stood up and prayed
in a group.

[619j1). It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Prayer
in a group is twenty-seven times better than the prayer of a man by himself."

619b. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that he heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Prayer in a group
is twenty-five times better than the prayer of a man by himself."

620. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The group prayer is twenty-five degrees
higher than the prayer in your house or the prayer in your place of business.
If someone does *wudu'* and goes to the mosque with no other object
than to do the prayer, Allah will raise him up a degree with every step he
takes, and a wrong action will fall away from him. When he prays, the angels
pray for him all the time he is in his place of prayer, 'O Allah! Forgive
him! O Allah! Show mercy to him!' One of you is in the prayer as long as
he is waiting for the prayer."

**III: The excellence of doing the *Fajr* prayer in a group**

621. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "The
excellence of the group prayer is twenty-five times that of the prayer of
one of you alone. The angels of the night and the angels of the day meet
during the Fajr prayer.'"

Then Abu Hurayra said, "If you wish, recite, *'for the recitation of Fajr
is witnessed'"*

It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "It is twenty-seven times better."

622. It is related that Umm ad-Darda' was heard to say, "Once Abu'd-Darda'
came home angry. I said, 'What has made you angry?' He said, 'By Allah, the
only thing I see the community of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, still doing is praying in a group.' "

623. It is related from Abu Musa that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "The people who get the greatest reward for the prayer
are those who live furthest away and then the next furthest. Someone who
waits for the prayer so that he can pray it with the Imam has a greater reward
than someone who prays and then goes to sleep."

**IV: The excellence of doing *Dhuhr* early in its time**

624. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If a man who is
walking along on a road finds a thorny branch in the road and removes it,
Allah thanks him for doing it and forgives him." Then he said, "There are
five categories of martyr: someone killed by the plague, someone killed by
an abdominal disease, someone who drowns, someone who is killed by a collapsing
building and the martyr killed fighting in the way of Allah." He also said,
"If people knew what was in the call to prayer and the first row, and they
could find no other way to it than to draw lots for it, they would draw lots
for it. And if they knew what was in doing *Dhuhr* at its time, they
would race each other to it. And if they knew what was in the prayers of
*'Isha*' and *Subh*, they would come to them even if they had to
crawl."

**V: The reward for footprints left**

625. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "O Banu Salima, do you not expect something for the footprints
you have left?"

Mujahid said about His words, *"We record what they send ahead and what
they leave behind"* (36:12) means "their footprints."

It is related from Anas that the Banu Salima wanted to move from their place
and settle in the vicinity the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, but the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
disliked the idea of them moving to Madina, and said, "Do you not expect
a reward for your footprints?" Mujahid said that their footprints mean the
marks the feet leave on the ground as they walk."

**VI: The excellence of praying *'Isha'* in a group**

626. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There is no prayer heavier on the hypocrites
than *Fajr* and *'Isha'*. If they only knew what is in them, they
would come to them even if they had to crawl. I seriously considered ordering
the *mu'adhdhin* to give the *iqama*, instructing a man to lead
the people in prayer, and then taking a burning torch and setting fire to
those who had not yet gone out to the prayer."

**VII: Two or more makes a group**

627. It is related from Malik ibn al-Huwayrith that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When it is time for the prayer, then
the two of you should give the *adhan* and the *iqama* and the
elder should act as the Imam."

**VIII: Someone who sits in the mosque waiting for the prayer and the excellence
of mosques**

[628t54). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The angels
pray for every one of you as long as you remain in the place in which you
prayed and do not break *wudu'*, saying, 'O Allah, forgive him! O Allah,
show mercy to him!'' Each of you is in the prayer as long as he is waiting
for it and there is nothing but the prayer preventing him from going to his
family."

629. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "There are seven whom Allah will shade with His
shade on the day when there is no shade but His shade: a just Imam, a youth
who grows up worshipping Allah, a man whose heart is attached to the mosque,
two men who love each other for the sake of Allah alone, meeting for that
reason and parting for that reason, a man who refuses the advances of a noble
and beautiful woman, saying, 'I fear Allah', a man who gives *sadaqa*
and conceals it so that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives,
and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes overflow with
tears."

630. Anas was asked, "Did the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, wear a ring?" He said, "Yes, he delayed the *'Isha'*
prayer until the middle of the night and then prayed. Then he he turned
his face to us after he had prayed and said, 'The people have prayed and
gone to sleep, but you were in prayer the whole time you were waiting for
it.'" Anas said, "It is as if I could see the white glint of his ring on
that day."

**IX: The excellence of someone who goes to the mosque in the morning and
the evening**

631. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Allah will prepare a residence in the Garden
for anyone who goes to the mosque morning and evening each morning and evening
that they go."

**X: Once the *iqama* has been given, there is no prayer except the
obligatory prayer**

632. It is related that Malik ibn Buhayna said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, passed by a man...."

(By another isnad) A man of the Azd called Malik ibn Buhayna said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw a man praying two
*rak'ats* after the *iqama* for the prayer had been given. When
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, finished,
the people surrounded him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to him, 'Does *Subh* have four *rak'ats*?
Does *Subh* have four *rak'ats*?'

It was corroborated by Ghandar and Mu'adh from Shu'ba in Malik. (Two other
*isnads* given)

**XI: What can keep a sick man from attending the group prayer**

633. It is related that al-Aswad said, "We were with 'A'isha and we discussed
being constant in the prayers and honouring them. She said, 'When the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was ill with the illness
from which he died and it was time for the prayer and the adhan was given,
he said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. He was told, "Abu Bakr
is a tender-hearted man. If he stands in your place, he will not be able
to lead the people in the prayer." He repeated what he had said and they
repeated what they had said. He repeated it a third time and said, "You are
the companions of Yusuf! Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." So
Abu Bakr came out and prayed. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, felt better and came out walking between two men. It
is as if I could see his legs dragging because of the pain of the illness.
Abu Bakr wanted to draw back and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, indicated to him, "Stay in your place." Then he was brought until
he sat beside him.' "

Al-A'mash was asked "Was the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
praying with Abu Bakr following his prayer and the people praying following
the prayer of Abu Bakr." He indicated yes with his head

Part of it is related from al-A'mash. Abu Mu'awiya added, "He sat to the
left of Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr prayed standing."

634. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, became seriously ill and his pain was intense, he
asked his wives for permission to be looked after in my house and was given
permission. He came out between two men, with his feet dragging along the
ground. He was between al-'Abbas and another man.'

'Ubaydullah said, "I mentioned to Ibn 'Abbas what 'A'isha had said and he
said to me, 'Do you know who the man was whom 'A'isha did not name?' I answered,
'No.' He said, 'It was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib.'"

**XII: The dispensation to pray at home when it is wet or when there is
a good reason for doing so**

635. It is related that Nafi' said, "Ibn 'Umar gave the *adhan* on a
cold, windy night and then said, 'Pray in your homes.' Then he said, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to tell
the *mu'adhdhin* to say, 'Pray in your homes' when it was a cold, wet
night."

636. It is related from Mahmud ibn ar-Rabi' al-Ansari that 'Itban ibn Malik
used to lead his people in prayer. He was a blind man and he said to the
Messenger of Allah, "Messenger of Allah, my eyesight is weak and sometimes
it is dark and there is flood -water, so, Messenger of Allah, pray in my
house so that I can use it as a prayer-place." The Messenger of Allah came
to him and said, "Where would you like me to pray?" He pointed out a place
in the house. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed in it.

**XIII: Can the imam lead only those who are present in prayer? Should he
give a *khutba* on the day of Jumu'a if it is raining?**

637. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith was heard to say, "Ibn 'Abbas
addressed us on a muddy day and when the *mu'adhdhin* reached 'Come
to prayer,' he ordered him to say, 'Pray in your houses.' Some people looked
at others as if to say they did not like it. He said, 'It seems that you
dislike this? One better than me did this,' meaning the Prophet. 'It is a
bounden duty and I was most reluctant to bring you out.' "

It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said something similar although he said, "I
did not want you to feel you were doing wrong and therefore to come, covered
with mud up to the knees."

638. Abu Salama related that he questioned  Abu Sa'id al-Khudri [about the Night of Power) and he said, "A cloud came and it rained
to the exent that the roof, which was made of palm branches, leaked. The
*iqama* for the prayer was given and I saw the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, prostrate in the water and mud. I could
see the mark of the mud on his forehead."

639. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "A man of the Ansar said,
'I am unable to come and pray with you.' He was a large man. He prepared
some food for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and invited
him to his house. He spread out a straw mat for him, wetting one side of
it. He prayed two rak'ats on it." A man from the family of al-Jarud asked
Anas, "Did the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray the
*Duha* prayer?" He said, "That day was the only time I ever saw him
pray it."

**XIV: When food has been served and the *iqama* for the prayer has been
given.**

Ibn 'Umar used to have the evening meal first. Abu'd-Darda' said, "It is
part of a man's understanding to attend to his need so that he can attend
to his prayer with a clear heart.

640. It is related that 'A'isha was heard to say that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If the evening meal is served and the
*iqama* for the prayer is given, have the meal first."

641. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If the evening meal has been served,
then have it first before you pray Maghrib and do not rush your meal."

642. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "If your evening meal has been served
and the *iqama* for the prayer is given, then have the meal first and
finish it without rushing it."

When food was served to Ibn 'Umar and the *iqama* was given, he would
not go to the prayer until he had finished, even if he heard the Imam reciting.

Ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "When one of you is eating, he should not rush but should eat as much
as he needs to, even if the *iqama* of the prayer is given.

Another *isnad*.

**XV: When the imam is called to the prayer when he has something to eat in his
hand**

643. It is related from Ja'far ibn 'Amr ibn Umayya said that his father said,
"I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, eating
a shoulder from which he was cutting pieces. He was called to the prayer
and stood up and put the knife down and prayed without doing *wudu'*.

**XVI: Someone who is doing something in the house when the *iqama*
is given for the prayer and he goes out**

644. It is related that al-Aswad said, "I asked 'A'isha, 'What did the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to do in his house?' She said,
'He would do the household chores, i.e. serve his family. When it was time
for the prayer, he would go out to the prayer.' "

**XVII: Someone praying in front of people for no other reason than to teach
them how the Prophet did the prayer and his *sunna***

645. Ayyub related that Abu Qilaba said, "Malik ibn al-Huwayrith came here
to our mosque and said, 'I shall pray in front of you and what I intend by
this prayer is to [demonstrate to you how to]  pray in the way that I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, praying.'" Ayyub asked Abu Qilaba, "How did he
pray?" He replied, "He prayed in the same way as our shaykh ['Amr ibn Salama] here." The shaykh
would sit back after raising his head from the prostration before he stood
up after the first *rak'at*.

**XVIII: The people of knowledge and excellence have more right to lead the
prayer**

646. It is related that Abu Musa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was ill and his illness became much worse,
so he said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' 'A'isha said, 'Abu
Bakr is a gentle man. If he stands in your place, he will not be able to
lead the people in the prayer.' He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people
in prayer.' and she repeated what she had said. He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr lead
the people in prayer. You are the companions of Yusuf!' So he led the people
in prayer during the lifetime of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.

647. It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin, said,
"During his [final] illness, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'Tell Abu Bakr lead the people in prayer.'" 'A'isha said, "I
said, 'If Abu Bakr stands in your place, he will not be able to make people
hear because of his weeping, so tell 'Umar to lead the people in prayer.'"
'A'isha said, "I said to Hafsa, 'Say to him, "If Abu Bakr stands in your
place, he will not be able to make the people hear because of his weeping,
so tell 'Umar to lead the people in prayer."' Hafsa did it and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Stop this!
You are the companions of Yusuf! Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.'
" Hafsa said to 'A'isha, "I have never got any good from you!"

648. It is related from Anas ibn Malik al-Ansari, who used to serve and follow
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and kept him company,
"Abu Bakr led the people in prayer during the final illness of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, until Monday came. The people were
lined up for the prayer and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, lifted the curtain of his room and looked out at us while standing
there. His face was like a page of the Qur'an. Then he smiled joyfully. We
were severely tested by the joy of seeing the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace. Abu Bakr fell back to join the row thinking that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was coming out to the prayer.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, indicated to us, 'Complete
your prayer.' and let the curtain drop. That was the very day he died.' "

649. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, did not come out for three days. Once after the *iqama*
for the prayer had been given, Abu Bakr went forward." He continued, "The
Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took hold of the
curtain and lifted it. No sight could have been more pleasing to us than
the face of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when his
face appeared before us. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
indicated with his hand to Abu Bakr to go forward. Then the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, let the curtain drop and we did not
see him again until he died."

650. It is related from Hamza ibn 'Abdullah that his father informed him,
"When the illness of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, grew worse, he was asked about the prayer. He said, 'Tell Abu
Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' 'A'isha said, 'Abu Bakr is a gentle man.
When he recites, he is overcome by tears.' He said, 'Tell him to lead the
prayer.' She repeated her words. He said, 'Tell him to lead the prayer. You
are the companions of Yusuf!' "

It was corroborated by az-Zuhri.

Another *isnad*.

**XIX: Someone standing beside the imam if there is a good reason for it**

651. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered Abu Bakr to lead
the people in prayer during his illness, and he led them in the prayer."
'Urwa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
felt somewhat better and came out when Abu Bakr was leading the people. When
Abu Bakr saw him, he fell back, but he indicated to him, 'Remain where you
are.' So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
sat down beside Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr prayed following the prayer of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the people
prayed following the prayer of Abu Bakr."

**XX: If someone goes forward to lead the people in prayer and the normal
Imam comes, his prayer is valid whether he retires or not.**

'A'isha related something concerning this matter from the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.

652. It is related from Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went
to make peace among the Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf and the time for the prayer came [while he was away doing this]. .
The *mu'adhdhin* came to Abu Bakr and asked, "Will you lead the prayer and
I will do the *iqama*?" He said, "Yes." Abu Bakr led the prayer. The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, arrived while
the people were doing the prayer and went through [the rows] until he was standing in
the [front] row. The people clapped but Abu Bakr did not turn round from his prayer.
When the people increased their clapping, he turned and saw the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, indicated to him, "Stay where you
are." Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised Allah for what the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had commanded and then
fell back until he was level with the row. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went forward and led the prayer. When he finished,
he asked, "Abu Bakr, what stopped you from remaining where you were when I
commanded you?" Abu Bakr said, "It is not for the son of Abu Quhafa to pray in front
of the Messenger of Allah," The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Why did I see you all clapping so much? If something
happens during the prayer, you should say, '*Subhana'llah*.' If you
say this, attention will be paid to you. Clapping is for women."

**XXI: When people are equal in recitation, the oldest of them should act
as Imam**

653. It is related that Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said, "We went to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we were a group of young men.
We stayed with him for twenty days and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was merciful. He said, 'When you return to your country,
teach them and instruct them. They should pray such-and-such at such-and-such
a time and such-and-such a prayer at such-and-such a time. When it is time
for prayer, one of you should give the *adhan* and the oldest of you
should be the Imam."

**XXII: If the imam visits people and leads them in prayer**

654. It is related that 'Itban ibn Malik al-Ansari was heard to say, "The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked for permission to
enter and I gave it to him. He said, 'Where would you like me to pray in
your house?' I indicated the place I wanted. He stood up and we formed rows
behind him. Then [after he had prayed], he said the *salam* and so did we."

**XXIII: The imam is appointed to be followed**

In his final illness, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
led the people in prayer while sitting down.

Ibn Mas'ud said, "If someone
lifts his head before the Imam, he must lower it again and leave it there
for the length of time he lifted it. Then he should follow the Imam again."
Al-Hasan said, "If someone performs two *rak'ats* with the Imam and is unable
to go into *sajda*, he should do *sajda* twice in the last
*rak'at* and then he should do the sajdas of the first *rak'at*. If someone
forgets to do those *sajda*s and stands up he should still do them."

655. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Utba said, "I visited
'A'isha and said, 'Will you tell me about the [final] illness of the Messenger of
Allah?' She said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, became very ill and asked, 'Have the people prayed?" We answered,
"No, they are waiting for you." He said, "Put some water into a container
for me."' She said, 'We did that and he washed and then tried to get up but
he passed out. Then he regained consciousness and asked, "Have the people prayed?" We replied,
"No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah." He said, "Put some water
into a container for me." ' She said, "He sat up and washed and then tried
to stand up and passed out again. Then he recovered and asked, "Have the people
prayed?" We replied, "No, they are waiting for you Messenger of Allah." He said,
"Put some water into a container for me." He sat up and washed and then tried
to stand up and passed out. Then he recovered and asked, "Have the people
prayed?" We said, "No, they are waiting for you Messenger of Allah." The
people were waiting in the mosque for the Prophet, peace be upon him, for
the*'Isha'* prayer. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
sent for Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. The messenger went to
him and said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, orders you to lead the people in the prayer." Abu Bakr, who was a
tender man, said, "'Umar, you lead the people in the prayer." 'Umar said
to him, "You are more entitled to do it." Abu Bakr led the prayer during
those days. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, felt
better and came out between two men, one of whom was al-'Abbas, for the
*Dhuhr* prayer. Abu Bakr was leading the prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him,
he began to fall back but the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, indicated to him that he should not do so. He said [to the two men], "Sit me down beside
him." They sat him down beside Abu Bakr.'"

He said, "Abu Bakr began to pray following the prayer of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the people followed the prayer of
Abu Bakr. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sitting
down."

'Ubaydullah said, "I visited 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas and said to him, 'Shall
I tell you what 'A'isha related to me about the [final] illness of the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace?' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Go on,' and I told
him her *hadith*. He did not disacknowledge any of it although he asked,
'Did she name to you the man who was with al-'Abbas?' I answered, 'No.' He said,
'It was 'Ali.' "

656. It is related that 'A'isha, Umm al-Mu'minin,
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, once
prayed in his room when he was ill. He prayed sitting down and some people
prayed behind him standing. He indicated to them to sit down. When he had
finished, he said, 'The Imam is only appointed to be followed. When he goes
into *ruku'*, go into *ruku'*, and when he rises, rise and if he
prays sitting down, pray sitting down.' "

657. It is related from Anas ibn Malik, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, fell off his
horse when riding, and his right side was grazed, so he did one of the prayers
sitting down, and we prayed behind him sitting down. When he had finished
he said, 'The Imam is appointed to be followed. If he prays standing, then
pray standing, and when he goes into *ruku'*, go into *ruku'*,
and when he rises, rise, and when he says, "Allah hears whoever praises him,"
say, "Our Lord, praise belongs to you," and if he prays standing, pray standing,
and if he prays sitting down, then all of you pray sitting down.' "

Al-Humaydi said, "His words, 'If he prays sitting down, pray sitting down' referred
to his earlier illness. Then after that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, prayed sitting down and the people behind him were standing
and he did not order them to sit. It is the latest of the actions of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which should be acted upon.'"

**XXIV: When should those behind an imam go into *sajda*?**

Anas said, "Go into *sajda* when he goes into *sajda*."

658. 'Abdullah ibn Yazid related that al-Bara' - and he was not lying - said, "When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah
hears whoever praises him," none of us bent his back until the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had gone into *sajda*. Then we
would go into *sajda* after him."

Something similar to this related from Abu Ishaq.

**XXV: The wrong action of someone who raises his head before the imam**

659. It is related that Abu Hurayra was heard to say that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not those of you who raise
their heads before the Imam fear lest Allah turn their heads into donkey-heads
or that Allah will make their shape that of a donkey?"

**XXVI: A slave or *mawla* (freed slave) leading the prayer**

'A'isha's slave, Dhakwan, led her in the prayer, reading from a copy of the
Qur'an. Is it permitted for a bastard, a Bedouin or boy who has not yet reached
puberty to lead the prayer following the statement of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, "The person among them who knows more of the
Book of Allah should lead them"?

660. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The first Muhajirun came to al-'Usba,
a place at Quba', before the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, arrived. Salim, the mawla of Abu Hudhayfa, used to lead
them in prayer. Of them, he had the most knowledge of the Qur'an."

661. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Listen and obey, even if an Abyssinian with a head like
a raisin is appointed over you."

**XXVII: If the imam does not complete the prayer properly and those behind
him do**

662. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "They (the imams) pray on your behalf. If they
are correct, both you and they have the reward. If they make a mistake, you have
the reward and the penalty is theirs."

**XXVIII: The imamate of someone who is subject to *fitna* or an
innovator**

Al-Hasan said, "Pray and he will pay the price of his innovation."

663. It is related that 'Ubaydullah ibn Khiyar went to 'Uthman ibn 'Affan
when he was under siege and said, "You are the Imam of all the Muslims and
yet see what has happened to you. An Imam following *fitna* is leading
us in prayer and we are therefore forced into wrong action." He said, "The
prayer is the best action people can do. If people do good actions, do good
actions with them. If they do bad actions, avoid their bad actions."

Az-Zuhri said, "We do not think that anyone should pray behind an effeminate
man except when there is no other option."

664. It is related that Anas said to Abu Dharr: See 661.

**XXIX: Standing on the right of the imam, level with him, when there are
only two persons**

665. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I spent the night in the house
of my aunt Maymuna and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, prayed *'Isha'* and then came and prayed fou*r rak'ats*
and then slept. Then he got up and I came and stood at his left and he
moved me to his right. He prayed fiv*e rak'ats* and then prayed two
and then slept until I heard him snore (or breathe heavily). Then he went
out for the prayer."

**XXX: If a man stands to the left of the imam, the imam should move him
to his right, and that does not invalidate the prayer of either of them**

666. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I slept at the house of Maymuna
on a night when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
with her. He did *wudu'* and then stood up and prayed and I stood at
his left. He took me and moved me to his right and prayed thirteen *rak'ats*
and then slept until he was exhaling deeply. When he slept, he exhaled
deeply. Then the *mu'adhdhin* came to him and he went out and prayed
without doing *wudu'*.

Slighty different *isnad*.

**XXXI: When the imam has not made the intention of leading the prayer and
then people come and he leads them**

667. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I spent the night with my aunt
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up to pray
in the night and I got up to pray with him. I stood on his left and he took
my head and made me stand on his right."

**XXXII: When the imam makes the prayer long and a man has something he
must do and leaves and then prays separately**

668. It is related that Mu'adh ibn Jabal used to pray with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then return and lead his people
in the prayer.

669. From 'Amr: see 668 (Then it continues), "He prayed *'Isha*' and
recited *al-Baqara*. A man left and it seemed as if Mu'adh disliked
that. This reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and he said, 'You are trying them too much. You are trying them too much,'
three times, or he said, 'A causer of trial! A causer of trial! A causer
of trial!' And he ordered him to recite two suras from the middle of the
*Mufassal*.'" 'Amr said, "I do not remember which they were."

**XXXIII: The imam making the standing short, but doing full *ruku'*
and *sajda***

670. It is related from Abu Mas'ud, "A man said, 'By Allah, Messenger of
Allah, I only fail to attend the morning prayer because so-and-so makes the
prayer too long for us.' I have never seen the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, more angry in giving admonition than he was
that day. Then he said, 'Some of you make things difficult for people. Any
of you who of you lead people in prayer should make it short. Among you there
are those who are weak, old and have things they must do.' "

**XXXIV: When praying alone, you can lengthen the prayer as much as you
wish**

671. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When
any of you leads other people in prayer, he should shorten it, for among
you are those who are weak, the sick and the old. When you pray by yourself, you can
lengthen the prayer as much as you wish."

**XXXV: Complaining about an Imam when he makes the prayer long**

Abu Usayd said, "My son, you have made it too long for us!"

672. It is related from Abu Mas'ud, "A man said, 'By Allah, Messenger of
Allah, I only fail to attend the morning prayer because so-and-so makes the
prayer too long for us.' I have never seen the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, more angry in any situation than he was that
day. Then he said, 'O people, some of you make things difficult for people.
Any of you who of you lead people in prayer should make it short. Among you
there are those who are weak, old and have things they must do.' "

673. It is related that Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari was heard to say, "A
man was driving two *nadiha* (agricultural) camels and night had fallen.
He found Mu'adh praying and made his camels kneel and joined Mu'adh who was
reciting *Surat al-Baqara* or *an-Nisa'*. The man left and then
heard that Mu'adh had disparaged him. He went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and complained to him about Mu'adh. The Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Mu'adh, are you someone who
tries them too much' or 'a causer of trial' three times. 'If only you had
prayed using *Sabbih isma rabbika* (87) and *Wa'sh-shamsi wa duhaha*
(91) or *Wa'l-layli idha yaghsha* (92). There are old and weak people
and those with things they must do who pray behind you.' " I think this is
in the *hadith*.

Sa'id ibn Masruq, Mis'ar and ash-Shaybani corroborated it.

Jabir said, "Mu'adh recited *al-Baqara* in *'Isha'.*

Muharib corroborated it.

674. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to make the prayer short, but would do it perfectly."

**XXXVI: Someone making the prayer short when hearing a child cry**

675. It is related that Abu Qatada said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I stand in prayer wanting to make it long
but I hear the crying of a child and shorten my prayer disliking to make
it difficult for its mother."

Bishr ibn Bakr, Ibn al-Mubarak and Baqiyya corroborated it from al-Awza'i.

676. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "I never prayed behind an Imam
with a easier or more perfect prayer than that of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. If he heard a child weeping, he would shorten
the prayer out of the fear of the mother finding it too much of a trial."

677. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I enter into the prayer wanting to make it
long and then, hearing the weeping of a child, I shorten my prayer because
I know the intensity of the anxiety of its mother at its weeping."

678. See 677.

The like of it is related from Anas from the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, with a different isnad.

**XXXVII: When someone has prayed and then leads the people in prayer**

679. It is related that Jabir said, "Mu'adh used to pray with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then go to his people and lead them in
the prayer."

**XXXVIII: Someone calling out the *takbir* after the imam so that
the people can hear**

680. It is related the 'A'isha said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, was ill with his final illness, someone came to him
to announce [that it was time for ]  the prayer. He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.' I said,
'Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man. If he stands in your place, he will weep
and will be unable to recite.' He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.'
I said the same again. He said a third or fourth time, 'But you are the
companions of Yusuf! Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.' So he led the prayer
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out supported
between two men. It is as if I could still see his legs dragging along the
ground. When Abu Bakr saw him, he started to fall back and the Prophet indicated
to him to continue the prayer. Abu Bakr moved back and the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, sat down beside him. Abu Bakr called out the
*takbir* so that the people could hear."

Al-A'mash corroborated it.

**XXXIX: A man following the imam and the people following the one who
is following someone else**

It is mentioned that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said [to the people of the first row], 
"Follow me and let those behind you follow you."

681. It is related that 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, became gravely ill, Bilal came to him to announce
the prayer. He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.' I
said, 'Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man. When he stands in your place, he
will be not be able to make people hear, so why not tell 'Umar to do it.
' He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer.' I said to Hafsa,
'Tell him, "Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man. When he stands in your place,
he will not be able to make the people hear, so why not tell 'Umar to do
it." ' He said, 'You are the companions of Yusuf! Tell Abu Bakr to lead the
people in the prayer.' When he had started the prayer, the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, felt better so he came out supported
between two men with his feet dragging along the ground until he entered
the mosque. When Abu Bakr heard him, he started to fall back and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, indicated to him not to.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came until
he sat down on the left of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr was praying standing and the
Messenger of Alla, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was praying sitting
down. Abu Bakr followed the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and the people followed the prayer of Abu Bakr."

**XL: Should the imam accept what people say if he is unsure about it?**

682. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, stopped praying after two *rak'ats* and
Dhu'l-Yadayn said to him, "Has the prayer been shortened or have you forgotten?"
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Has
Dhu'l-Yadayn spoken the truth?" The people said, "Yes." The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up and prayed another
two *rak'ats* and said the *salam*. Then he said the takbir and
did *sajda* the same as his previous *sajda* or a little longer.

683. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed *Dhuhr* with two *rak'ats.*
He was told, "You prayed two *rak'ats*." He prayed two more *rak'ats*
and then said the *salam* and did two *sajdas*."

**XLI: When the imam weeps in the prayer**

'Abdullah ibn Shaddad said, "While I was in the last row I heard 'Umar sobbing
as he recited, *'I complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah.'* (12:86)"

684. See 647.

**XLII: Making the rows straight at the time of the *iqama* and after
it**

685. It is related that an-Nu'man ibn Bashir was heard to say that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Make your rows straight or
Allah cause disagreements between you."

686. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Straighten the rows for I can see you behind my back."

**XLIII: The Imam facing the people when the rows are straight**

687. It is related that Anas said, "When the *iqama* for the prayer
was given, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
would turn round and face us. He said, 'Straighten your rows and stand close
together for I can see you behind my back.'"

**XLIV: The first row**

688. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Martyrs include: someone who drowns,
someone killed by the plague, someone killed by an abdominal disease, and someone
who is killed by a collapsing building."

He also said, "If people knew what
was in doing *Dhuhr* at its time, they would race each other to it.
And if they knew what was in the prayers of *'Isha*' and *Subh*,
they would come to them even if they had to crawl. If they knew what was
in the call to prayer and the first row, they would draw lots for it."

**XLV: Making the row straight is part of doing the prayer correctly**

689. It is related from Abu Hurayra from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "The imam was appointed to be followed
so do not differ from what he does. When he goes into *ruku'*, go into
*ruku*'. When he says, 'Allah hears whoever praises him,' say, 'Our
Lord, praise belongs to you.' When he goes into *sajda*, you go into
*sajda*. If he prays sitting down, then all pray sitting down and make
the rows straight in the prayer, for making the rows straight is part of the
beauty of the prayer."

690. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Make your rows straight. Straightening the rows is part
of establishing the prayer."

**XLVI: The wrong action of someone who does not make the rows straight**

691. Bushayr ibn Yasar al-Ansari related that Anas ibn Malik came to Madina and  was asked, "Is
there anything you disapprove of since the days you were with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." He said, "I do not disapprove
of anything except that you do not make the rows straight."

Bushayr ibn Yasar said, "Anas ibn Malik came to us in Madina."

**XLVII: Standing shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot in the row**

An-Nu'man ibn Bashir said, "I saw that each of our men would place his heel
against the heel of his companion."

692. Humayd related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Straighten the rows for I can see you behind my back." [Anas added], "Each of us would put his shoulder to his companion's shoulder and his foot against his foot."

**XLVIII: When a man is standing to the left of the imam and the imam moves
him behind him to his right, the prayer is sound**

693. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I prayed with the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, one night and stood to his left and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, held
me by the back of the head and moved me to his left. He prayed and then lay
down. The *mu'adhdhin* came to him and he got up and prayed without
doing *wudu*'."

**XLIX: A woman alone can constitute a row**

694. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "An orphan and I prayed in our
house behind the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and my
mother, Umm Sulaym, stood behind us."

**L: The right-hand side of the mosque and the imam**

695. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "One night I stood to pray at the
left of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he took
me by my hand or arm and stood me on his right. He indicated with his hand
for me to stand a little back."

**LI: When there is a wall or sutra between the imam and the people**

Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm in praying with a river between you and
him." Abu Miljaz said, "The imam can be followed, even if there is a road
or a wall in between as long as the *takbir* of the imam can be heard."

696. 'Amra related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray at night in his room. The wall
of the room was low so people could see the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace. Some people began to pray together following his prayer.
The following morning they talked about it and the next night when he got
up to pray some more people prayed together with his prayer. This went on
for two or three nights. Then, after that, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, remained seated and did not come out. In the
morning, the people mentioned this and he said, 'I was afraid that the night
prayer would become obligatory for you.' "

**LII: The Night Prayer**

697. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, had a mat which he would spread out in the day and use as
a screen as night. People gathered to him and prayed behind him.

698. It is related from Zayd ibn Thabit that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, stayed in a small room in Ramadan. (Sa'id
said, "I think that he said it was made out of a straw mat.") and he prayed
in it during the nights. Some of his Companions would pray together with
his prayer. When he became aware of this, he began to pray sitting down.
Then he went out to them and said, "I understand what you were doing but,
my people, pray in your homes. A man's best prayer is the one he prays in
his house with the exception of the obligatory prayer."

Different *isnad* from Zayd.
