**Chapter 4. The Book of
Wudu'**

**I: What is reported aboutÂ wudu'**

And the words of Allah the Almighty, *"When you stand for the prayer, wash
your faces and hands to the elbows and wipe your heads and wash your feet
to the ankles."* (5:6)

Abu 'Abdullah (i.e. al-Bukhari) said, "The Prophet made it clear that the
obligation of *wudu'* is to wash each part once. He also did *wudu'*
by washing two and three times, but not more than three." The people
of knowledge dislike extravagance in it and for people to exceed what the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did.

**II: The prayer is not accepted without a state of purity**

135. Abu Hurayra was heard to say that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "A prayer of someone in *hadath*
is not accepted until he renewes *wudu'*." A man from Hadramaut asked,
"What is *hadath*, Abu Hurayra?" He said, "Breaking wind silently or
with a noise."

**III: On the excellence of *wudu'*, and on the excellence of those
with white blazes on their foreheads and limbs from the effects of
*wudu'***

136. It is related that Nu'aym al-Mujmir said, "I went with Abu Hurayra onto
the roof of the mosque. He di*d wudu'* and said, 'I heard the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "On the Day of Rising my community
will be called 'those with white blazes on their foreheads and limbs' from
the effects of *wudu*'. So whoever of you can increase the extent of
the whiteness, should do so."'"

**IV: On not renewing *wudu'* because of doubt until you are certain
[that you have lost *wudu*']**

137. It is related from 'Abbad ibn Tamim from his uncle that he complained
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about
a man who thought that he had broken wind during the prayer. He said, "He
should not turn away or leave the prayer unless he hears a noise or smells
something."

**V: On doing wudu' lightly**

138. It is narrated from ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, slept to the extent that he snored and then prayed," or
he said, "He lay down to the extent that he snored and then got up and prayed."

Later on Sufyan reported the same incident reported the same incident repeatedly
that 'Amr related from Kurayb saying that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Once I spent
the night in the house of my aunt, Maymuna, and the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, got up during the night. After some of the night
had passed, the Prophet got up and did *wudu'* lightly from a hanging
waterskin - 'Amr (one of the narrators) described it as being light and used
little water - and stood up to pray. I did *wudu'* as the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had done and then went and stood on
his left. (Sufyan might have said *shimalihi* rather than
*yasarihi*) He moved me to his right and then prayed as much as Allah
willed and then lay down and went to sleep to the extent that he snored.
Then the caller came and announced the prayer, then the Prophet went with
him for the prayer and he prayed without doing *wudu'*.

Sufyan said, "We said to 'Amr that some people say, 'The eyes of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sleep but his heart does
not sleep.'"

'Amr said that he heard 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr say, "The dreams of the Prophets
are revelation." Then he recited [the conversation of Ibrahim to Isma'il],
*"I saw in a dream that I must sacrifice you."* (37:102)

**VI: On doing wudu' thoroughly**

Ibn 'Umar said, "Doing *wudu'* thoroughly means getting clean perfectly."

139. It is related that Usama ibn Zayd was heard to say [relating the Farewell
*Hajj* of the Prophet], "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, pushed on from 'Arafat until he came to a pass where
he dismounted, urinated and did *wudu'* but not thoroughly. I said,
'The prayer, Messenger of Allah!' He replied, 'The prayer is still ahead
of you.' He rode on and when he reached Muzdalifa, he dismounted and did
*wudu'* and did it thoroughly. Then the *Iqama* was given for the
prayer and he prayed *Maghrib*. Then everyone made their camels stay
kneeling where they were and the iqama was given for *'Isha'* and the
Prophet prayed it, and he did do any prayers between the two prayers."

**VII: On washing the face with both hands using a handful of water**

140. It is related from 'Ata' ibn Yasar that when Ibn 'Abbas did
*wudu',* he washed his face, took a handful of water and rinsed out
his mouth and then cleaned his nose by sniffing up water and blowing out
again. Then he took a handful of water and did like this, (putting his hands
together and washing his face with them). Then he took a handful of water
and washed his right arm. Then he took a handful of water and washed his
left arm. Then he wiped his head. Then he took a handful of water and sprinkled
it on his right foot until he had washed it. Then he took another handful
of water and washed his left foot with it. Then he said, "This is how I saw
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, doing
*wudu'*."

**VIII: Saying "In the name of Allah" in every situation [in the beginning]
including during sexual relations with one's wife**

141. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "If one of you comes to his wife and says, 'In
the name of Allah. O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect any child
You grant us from Shaytan,' and a child is decreed for them, Shaytan will
not harm him."

**IX: On what to say when going to the lavatory**

142. Anas was heard to say, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, entered the lavatory, he would say, 'O Allah, I seek refuge with
you from foulness and the foul ones (shaytans)."

[Ibn 'Ar'ara corroborated with Adam in relating from Shu'ba.

The narration of Ghandar Shu'ba has "When he came to the lavatory" (in place
of entered).

Musa relates from Hammad, "When he entered."

Sa'id ibn Zayd related from 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, "When he wanted to enter."]

**X: On placing water by the lavatory**

143. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, entered the lavatory and I placed water there for him. He
said, "Who put this here?" He was informed, and then he said, 'O Allah, give
him [i.e. Ibn 'Abbas] understanding of the *deen*.'"

**XI: On not facing the *qibla* when defecating or urinating except
when screened by a building, or by a wall or the like [as a heap of stones,
etc.]**

144. It is related that Abu Ayyub al-Ansari said that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When any of you goes to relieve
himself, he should not face the *qibla* nor turn his back on it. He
should face either the east or west."

**XII: On defecating while sitting on two bricks**

145. Wasi' ibn Habban related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar used to say, "People
were saying, 'Whenever you sit to relieve yourself, you should not face either
the *qibla* or the direction of Jerusalem." So 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said,
"One day I went up onto the roof of a house of ours and saw the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, relieving himself while
sitting on two bricks facing the direction of Jerusalem."

Ibn 'Umar asked Wasi', "Perhaps you are one of those who pray on their haunches?"
The answer was, "By Allah, I do not know." Malik said, "He means those who
pray without lifting themselves from the ground properly, who cleave close
to the ground in prostration."

**XIII: On women going out to relieve themselves**

146. It is related from 'A'isha that the wives of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to go out to al-Manasi' at night to defecate.
It was a vast open plain. 'Umar used to tell the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, "Veil your wives," but the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not do it. One night Sawda bint
Zam'a, the wife of the Prophet, went out in the evening. She was a tall woman
and 'Umar called to her, "We have recognised you, Sawda!" He was keen for
an instruction regarding the veil to be revealed and then Allah sent down
the ayat of veiling.

It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said [to his wives], "You have been permitted to go out to fulfill
your need."

Hisham said that he meant defecation.

**XIV: On defecating in houses**

147. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "I went up onto the roof
of Hafsa's house for a particular purpose and saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, relieving himself with his back
to the *qibla*, facing Syria."

148. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "One day I went up onto
the roof of our house and saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, sitting on two bricks facing Jerusalem."

**XV: On cleansing the private parts with water (*istinja'*)**

149. It is related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself, I and
another boy would go along with a container of water," i.e. so that he could
use it for cleansing himself.

**XVI: On someone having water carried with him for purification purposes**

Abu'd-Darda' said, "Is there not among you one called 'carrier of the sandals,
purification water and cushion'?"*

150. It is related that Anas was heard to say, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself, I and
one of the other boys from our tribe with us used to follow him with a container
of water."

[*'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud.]

**XVII: On carrying a spear (*'anaza*) together with the water used for
*istinja'***

151. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went apart to relieve himself, I
and a boy would carry a container of water and a spear so that he could cleanse himself
with water."

An-Nadr and Shadhan corroborated this from Shu'ba.

An *'anaza* is a staff with a spearhead on it.

**XVIII: On the prohibition against  cleansing oneself in the lavatory with
the right hand**

152. It is related from Abu Qatada from his father that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you drinks,
he should not breathe into the vessel. When he relieves himself, he should
not touch his private parts with his right hand nor wipe himself with his
right hand."

**XIX: On not holding the private parts with the right hand while
urinating**

153. It is related from Abu Qatada from his father that the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When one of you urinates, he
should not hold his private parts with his right hand nor should he cleanse
with his right hand, and he should not breathe into a (drinking) vessel."

**XX: On cleansing using stones**

154. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "I followed the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, who went out to relieve himself and he did
not look around. When I came near him, he said, 'Go and look for some stones
with which I can cleanse myself (or something like that). Do not bring me
bones or dung.' I brought him some stones in the corner of my garment and
placed them beside him and left him. When he finished, he cleansed them."

155. It is related that 'Abdullah was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went to relieve himself and told me to bring
him three stones. I found two stones and looked for a third, but could not
find one. I took a piece of dried dung and took it to him. He took the two
stones and threw away the dung, saying, 'This is unclean.'"

**XXI: Perfoming *wudu'*, washing each part once only**

156. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, performed *wudu'*, washing each part once only."

**XXII: Performing *wudu'*, washing the parts twice**

157. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Zayd that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, performed wudu', washing the parts twice.

**XXIII: Perfoming *wudu'*, washing the parts three times**

[158](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#p30). It is reported from Humran, the *mawla*
of 'Uthman, that he saw 'Uthman ibn 'Affan call for a container of water
which he poured over his hands three times, washing them. Then he put his
right hand in the vessel and rinsed out his mouth and cleaned his nose by
sniffing up water and blowing out. Then he washed his face three times and
he washed his forearms to the elbows three times. Then he wiped his head
and washed his feet to the ankles three times. Then he said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever does
*wudu'* like this and then prays two *rak'ats* in which he does
not become distracted will have his past wrong actions forgiven.'

'Urwa related from Humran, "When 'Uthman had done *wudu'*, he said,
'I will tell you a *hadith* which I would not  have told you if
it had not been for a certain *ayat*. I heard the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, "If a man does wudu' and does it well
and prays, Allah will be forgiven everything that he does between then and
the time when he prays the next prayer."'"

'Urwa said that the *ayat* was*, "those who conceal the clear signs
We have sent down"* . (2:159)

**XXIV: On cleaning the nose with water by sniffing up and blowing out again
in *wudu*'**

'Uthman, 'Abdullah ibn Zayd and Ibn 'Abbas related it from the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace.

[159](http://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari3.html#p3). Abu Hurayra was heard to say that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,"The person doing
*wudu'* should snuff water up his nose and blow it out again."

**XXV: Cleansing the private parts with an odd number of stones**

[160](http://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari3.html#p2). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When you do wudu',
snuff water into your nose and blow it out, and if you use stones to clean
your private parts use an odd number. When you wake up from sleep you should
wash your hands before putting them in the *wudu'* water, for none of
you knows where his hands were during the night."

**XXVI: Washing both feet and should not just wiping them**

161. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, stayed behind us on a journey; we travelled,
and he caught up with us when thr time for *'Asr* was overdue and we
were doing *wudu'*, merely wiping over our feet [not washing very well].
He called out in a loud voice two or three times, 'Woe to the heels on account
of the Fire!'"*

[*Because without washing the feet, *wudu'* is not
complete and the one who has no wudu has no prayer, and the one who does
not pray goes to the Fire unless Allah has mercy on him.]

**XXVII: On rinsing out the mouth in *wudu'***

This was mentioned by Ibn 'Abbas and 'Abdullah ibn Zayd from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace

162. It is related from Humran, the mawla of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, that he
saw 'Uthman call for water fo*r wudu'* which he poured from the container
over his hands. He washed them three times, and then put his right hand into
the water, rinsed out his mouth and sniffed up water into his nose and blew
it out again. Then he washed his face three times and his arms to the elbows
three times. Then he wiped his head and washed each foot three times. Then
he said, "I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do
*wudu'* like this and he said, Whoever does *wudu'* like this and
then prays two *rak'ats* in which he does not become distracted will
have his past wrong actions forgiven.'"

**XXVIII. CHAPTER: Washing the heels**

When Ibn Sirin did wudu', he used to wash the skin covered by his ring

163. It is related from Muhammad ibn Ziyad, "I heard Abu Hurayra say as he
was passing by us at a time when some people were doing *wudu'* from
a water-container, "Do *wudu'* thoroughly, for Abu'l-Qasim, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Woe to the heels on account of the
Fire!"'"

**XXIX: Washing the feet when wearing sandals and not wiping over them**

164. It is related from 'Ubayd ibn Jurayj that he said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar,
"O Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman! I saw you doing four things which I did not see any
of your companions doing."

He asked, "What are those things, Ibn Jurayj?"

He said, "I saw that you did not touch any of the corners (of the Ka'ba)
except for the two Yemeni ones and I saw you wearing sandals of tanned leather.
I saw you dyeing your hair with yellowish colouring. I saw that when you
were in Makka the people were saying the talbiya when they saw the new moon
while you did not say the *talbiya* until the Day of Tarwiya (the 8th
of Dhu'l-Hijja)."

'Abdullah said, "Regarding the corners, I only saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, touch only the two Yemeni corners
(of the Ka'ba). As for the tanned sandals, I saw the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wearing hairless sandals and doing
*wudu'* in them, so I like to wear them. As for dyeing the hair, I saw
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, dyeing his
hair with henna and so I like to dye my hair with it. As for the *talbiya*,
I did not see the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
doing the *talbiya* until his mount set out for *hajj*."

**XXX: Starting with the right when performing *wudu'* and
*ghusl***

165. It is related that Umm 'Atiyya said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to the woman when they were washing his [deceased]
daughter, "Begin with her right hand side and the places which are washed
in *wudu'*."

166. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, liked to begin with the right when putting on his shoes,
combing his hair, in purification and in all things.

**XXXI: Looking for water for *wudu'* when the time for the prayer
is at hand**

'A'isha said, "When it was time for *Subh* prayer, people looked for water but none could be found, so *tayammum* was revealed."

[167](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#p33). It is related that Anas ibn Malik said,
"I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when
it was near the time of *'Asr* and people were looking for water [for
*wudu'*] but could not find any. Then water was brought to the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, placed his hand in that vessel and
told people to d*o wudu*' from it. I saw the water gushing up from under
his fingers until every last one of them had done *wudu'*."

**XXXII: On water with which human hair has been washed.**

'Ata' saw no harm in using hair for thread and ropes.

Also about things dogs have licked and their passing through the mosque.

Az-Zuhri said, "You can do wudu' with water which has been licked by a dog
when you have no other water."

Sufyan [ath-Thawri] said, "This ruling derives from deep understanding of where Allah says*,
'If you do not find water, then do tayammum.'"* (5:6) And this is water.
However, there is something doubtful about it. So one should use it to do
*wudu'* and then do *tayammum* also.

168. It is related that Ibn Sirin said, "I told 'Abida [as-Salmani], 'I
have some of the hair of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
which I got from Anas or Anas's family.' He said, "If I had a single one
of those hairs, it would be dearer to me than this world and everything in
it."

169. It is related from Anas that when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had his head shaved, Abu Talha was the first
to take some of his hair.

**[Dogs]**

[170](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#p36). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If a
dog drinks from a vessel belonging to one of you, he should wash it seven
times."

171. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "A man saw a dog driven by thirst to eat mud,
so he took his leather sock and scooped up water for it until its thirst
was quenched. Allah rewarded him for that and admitted him to the Garden."

172. It is related from Hamza ibn 'Abdullah that his father ['Abdallah ibn 'Umar] said, "During
the [early days] of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, dogs used to urinate and go back and forth through the mosque.
Nevertheless, people were not sprinkling any water on the spot."

173. It is related that 'Adi ibn Hatim said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, [about hunting dogs]. He said, 'When
you release your trained dog and it kills, then eat. If the dog eats [part
of it], then you should not eat it for then the dog has taken the game for
itself.' I said, 'What if I let loose my dog and then find another dog with it?'
He said, 'Do not eat it for you have said the *basmala* over your dog
but not over the other one.'"

**XXXIII: Those who thought that *wudu' i*s only obligatory on account
of something discharging from the front or back passages**

The words of Allah*, "Or one of you comes from the lavatory." (5:6)*

'Ata' said that if a worm comes out of someone's anus or discharge from the
penis equal to the size of a louse, then he must repeat *wudu'*."

Jabir ibn 'Abdullah said, "If someone laughs in the prayer, he should repeat
the prayer, but not repeat *wudu'*."

Al-Hasan said, "If anyone removes some of his hair or cuts his nails or removes
his leather socks, he does not have to do *wudu'* on account of that."

Abu Hurayra said, "*Wudu'* should only be repeated on account of
*hadath*."

It is mentioned that Jabir stated that while the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was in the Dhat ar-Riqa' expedition, a man was shot with
an arrow and he bled profusely but he bowed, prostrated and continued his
prayer.

Al-Hasan said, "The Muslims used to continue to pray when they were wounded."

Tawus, Muhammad ibn 'Ali, 'Ata' and the people of the Hijaz said, "*Wudu'*
is not done on account of bleeding."

Ibn 'Umar squeezed one of his pimples and blood came out of it but he did
not do *wudu*'.

Ibn Abi Awfa spat out blood and continued his prayer.

Ibn 'Umar and al-Hasan said that a person who has been bled only has to wash
the place of the incision.

174. It is related that Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The servant is in a state of prayer during
the time he is waiting for the prayer in the mosque as long as he does not
break *wudu'* (by *hadath*)." A non-Arab asked, "What is
*hadath*, Abu Hurayra?" He replied, "A noise" i.e. passing wind from
the back passage.

175. It is related from 'Abbad ibn Tamim from his uncle that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A person should not leave
the prayer unless he hears a sound or smells something."

176. It is related that 'Ali said, "I was a man who got frequent emotional
urethral discharges (*madhiy*) and I was too embarrassed to ask the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,about it. Therefore
I asked al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad to do so. The Prophet said that you should do
*wudu'* on account of it.

Shu'ba related it from al-A'mash.

177. It is related from Zayd ibn Khalid that he asked 'Uthman ibn 'Affan,
may Allah be pleased with him, "What do you think about someone who has
intercourse but does not ejaculate?" 'Uthman answered, "He does *wudu'* as
one does *wudu'* for the prayer, but he must also wash his penis." 'Uthman
said, "I heard this from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace." Zayd said, "I asked 'Ali, az-Zubayr, Talha, and Ubayy ibn
Ka'b about that and they also gave the same instruction."

178. It is related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent for a man of the Ansar who
came with water dripping from his head. The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, asked, "Perhaps we have made you hurry [from intercourse]?"
He answered, "Yes." The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "If you are made to hurry or do not have discharge, then
you should do *wudu'*."

Wahb corroborated it, relating from Shu'ba.

Abu 'Abdullah [i.e. al-Bukhari] said that Ghundar and Yahya in their transmission from 
Shu'ba did not mention "*wudu'*."

**XXXIV: On a man helping his companion to perform *wudu'***

179. It is related from Usama ibn Zayd that when the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left 'Arafa, he turned aside into
a gulley and relieved himself. Usama ibn Zayd said, "I poured water for him
as he did *wudu'* and I asked, 'Messenger of Allah, are you going to
pray?' He said, 'The place of the prayer is still ahead of you.'"

180. It is related from al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba that he was with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and the Prophet
went out to relieve himself. Then Mughira poured the water for him while
he did wudu'. He washed his face and hands and wiped his head and wiped over
his leather socks.

**XXXV: The recitation of the Qur'an and other things [like writing the Qur'an]  after the occurrence
of *hadath***

Mansur quoted from Ibrahim, "There is no harm in reciting [Qur'an] in bathhouses
(*hammam*) or in writing letters while not in *wudu*'.

Hammad quoted Ibrahim as saying, "Greet them if they are wearing waist-wrappers.
Otherwise, do not greet them."

[181](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#11). It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas spent
the night in the house of Maymuna, the wife of the Messenger of Allah, who
was his maternal aunt. He said, "I lay down across the bed and the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his wife lay lengthwise.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, slept until
half the night had passedâ or thereabouts. Then the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, woke up, sat up and rubbed the sleep
from his face with his hands. Then he recited the last ten *ayats* from
*Surat Ali 'Imran*. Then he went to a hanging water-skin and did *wudu'*
from it, doing it thoroughly. Then he got up and prayed." Ibn 'Abbas
continued, "So I got up and did the same as he did and went and stood beside
him. He put his right hand on my head taking hold of my right ear and tweaking
it. He prayed two *rak'ats*, then another two, then another two, then
another two, then another two, and then another two. Then he did an odd one.
Then he lay down until the *mu'adhdhin* came to him. Then he prayed
two quick *rak'ats* and then went out and prayed *Subh*."

**XXXVI: On not doing *wudu'* except after falling into deep sleep**

182. It is related from Asma' bint Abi Bakr that she said, "I went to 'A'isha,
the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when there
was a solar eclipse. The people were standing in prayer and she was also
standing in prayer. I said, 'What are the people doing?' She pointed towards
the sky and said, 'Glory be to Allah!' I said, 'A sign?' She indicated that
it was so. I also stood to pray until I was overcome and fainted. I began
to pour water over my head. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, finished the prayer, he praised Allah and lauded
Him and then said, 'Anything which I did not see before I saw just now while
standing here, including the Garden and the Fire. It was revealed to me that
you will be tested in the graves with a like trial - or nearly like - [I
do not know exactly which Asma' said] to that of the False Messiah [Dajjal]. Each
of you will be approached and asked, "What do you know of this man? The believer
- or the one who is certain - [I do not know which exactly Asma' said] will
say, "He is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah who brought us the clear signs
and guidance. So we responded to him, believed and followed him." He will
be told, "Sleep, O virtuous one!" We know that you believed in him.' As for
the hypocrite or the doubter - [I do not know which Asma' said] he will say,

**XXXVII: On wiping the entire head according to the words of Allah,
*"wipe your heads."* (5:6)**

Ibn al-Musayyab said, "TA woman does the same as a man [in this],  and should wipe her head."

Malik was asked, "Is it enough to wipe part of the head?" For his argument [that it is not enough]

head.]

man said to 'Abdullah ibn Zayd, the grandfather of 'Amr ibn Yahya, "Can you
show me how the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
do *wudu'*?" 'Abdullah ibn Zayd said, "Yes," and asked for water. He
poured it onto his hands and them twice. He poured some out on to his hand
and washed them twice and then rinsed his mouth and snuffed water up his
nose and blew it out three times. Then he washed his face three times and
both of his arms up to the elbows twice. He then wiped his head with both

set up in front of him."

I drank some of his *wudu'* water. Then I stood behind him and saw the

peace, came out supported between two men, his feet dragging on the ground
- between 'Abbas and another man.

back-biting.' Then he called for a leafless palm branch and broke it into
two pieces and put one on each grave. He was asked, 'Messenger of Allah,
why did you do this?' He said, 'Perhaps their torture will be lightened for
them for as long as these do not dry up - or until they dry up.'"

wish he had not laid such great stress on this matter. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to the rubbish dump of a people
and urinated while standing."*

[* The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, used to urinate while sitting. 'A'isha said that the Prophet never
urinated while standing, but the Prophet did it to show that it is permissible.
'Umar, 'Ali and Zayd ibn Thabit and other Companions have urinated while
standing. Only one must be careful that it did not get on the clothes or

Abu Musa prayed at Dar al-Barid (the post house in Kufa) which had dung in
it when there was open ground beside it. He said, "Here and there are the
same."*

[*There is difference of opinion among scholars about
the urine and dung of animals. Some of them say that those animals whose
meats are halal, their urine and dung are not impure while others have the
opinion that it is impure.]

231. It is related that Anas said, "Some people came from [the tribe of]
'Ukl or 'Urayna and became ill. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, commanded them to go to the milk-camels and to drink their urine
and milk [for their treatment]. So they went, and when they were cured, they
killed the herdsman of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and took away the camels. The news arrived early in the day and the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent people on their trail. They
were brought to him in the middle of the day. He ordered that their hands
and feet be cut off and nails were driven in their eyes and they were cast
out into al-Harra'. They asked for water but none was given to them."

Abu Qilaba said, "These men stole and murdered and became unbelievers after
believing, and fought against Allah and His Messenger."

Ibn 'Abbas from Maymuna."

235. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising every wound which the Muslim

which does not flow. You might then need to wash in it.

**LXIX: If something filthy or dead is put on the back of someone who is
praying, it does not invalidate his prayer**

and then finds water still within the prayer time, he does not have to repeat
the prayer.

the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was in prostration...

him and grant him peace, was praying at the Ka'ba when Abu Jahl and his
companions were sitting there. One of them said to another, 'Which of you
will bring the placenta of a camel of the Banu so-and-so and put it on Muhammad's
back when he prostrates?' The most wretched of the people went and brought
it. He waited until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prostrated and then put it on his back between his shoulders. I was watching
but could not do anything to stop it. If only I had had some protectors!
They began to laugh and fall on one another while the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in prostration. He did not raise
his head until Fatima came to him and threw it off his back. Then he raised
his head and said, 'O Allah! Deal with the Quraysh!' three times. When he
cursed them it was unbearable for them. They were convinced that the supplication
would be accepted in that city." Then he said, "O Allah, deal with Abu Jahl,
and deal with 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, al-Walid ibn 'Utba, Umayya
ibn Khalaf and 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt,' and he mentioned a seventh whom I do
not remember. By the One who has my soul in His hand, I saw those whom the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had ennumerated
dead, [their bodies were thrown] in the well, the well of Badr."

**LXX: On spitting, blowing the nose, etc. on one's clothes**

bless him and grant him peace,spat and it fell on the hand of one of their
men, he would rub it on his face and skin."

238. It is related that Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, spat into his garment [while he was praying]."

Al-Bukhari said that Abu Maryam said that Yahya ibn Ayyub informed me, saying
that: Humayd informed me, "I heard Anas saying the same from the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

**LXXI: It is not permitted to do *wudu'* with *nabidh* nor any
intoxicant**

Al-Hasan and Abu'l-'Aliya disliked it.

'Ata' said, "I prefer *tayammum* to doing *wudu'* with
*nabidh* or milk."

239. It is related from 'A'isha that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Every drink which intoxicates is unlawful."

**LXXII: A woman washing blood from her father's face**

Abu'l-'Aliyya said, "Wipe my leg. It is injured."

240. It is related from Abu Hazim that he heard Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi being asked
by people and none was between me and him, "What was used to treat the wound
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace?" Sahl said, "There
is no one left alive who knows better than I do. 'Ali brought water
in his shield and Fatima used to wash the blood from his face. A straw mat
was taken and burnt and the wound filled with it."

**LXXIII: On Siwak**

Ibn 'Abbas said, "I spent the night with the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and he cleaned his teeth.

241. It is related from Abu Burda that his father said, "I came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and found him cleaning his teeth
with a siwak in his hand and saying, 'Augh! Augh!' as if he was retching
while the siwak was in his mouth."

242. It is related that Hudhayfa said, "When the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, got up at night, he used to clean his mouth with
the siwak."

**LXXIV: Giving the siwak to the oldest.**

243. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "I dreamt that I was using the siwak and two men came
to me, one of whom was older than the other. I gave the siwak to the younger
of them and I was told, 'Give it to the older,' so I gave it to the older
of them."

Abu 'Abdullah said that Nu'aym had a shortened version of it.

**LXXV: The excellence of someone who spends the night in *wudu'***

244. It is related from al-Bara' ibn 'Azib that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Whenever you go to bed, do *wudu'* as
you do *wudu'* for the prayer and then lie down on your right side.
Then say, 'O Allah, I have surrendered myself to You, entrusted my affair
to You and relied on You in hope and fear of You. There is no refuge nor
rescue from You except in You. O Allah, I have believed in Your Book which
You sent down and in Your Prophet whom You sent.' If you die that night,
then you will be in a state of pure human nature, i.e. Islam. Make that the
last of the words that you utter."

Al-Bara' said, "I repeated this to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and when I reached, 'I have believed in Your Book which You sent
down,' I said 'and Your Messenger' [instead of the Prophet] He said, 'No
- "Your Prophet whom You sent."'"
