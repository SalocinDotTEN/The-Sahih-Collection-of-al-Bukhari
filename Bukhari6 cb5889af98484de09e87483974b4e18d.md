**Chapter 12. The *Sutra* of
the One who Prays**

**I: The Imam's *sutra* is also the *sutra* for those behind him**

[471](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t41). It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "I came
riding up on a donkey while the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was leading the people in prayer at Mina, and I was at that
time nearing puberty. I passed in front of part of the row, dismounted, sent
the donkey off to graze, and then joined the row, and no one rebuked me for
doing so."

472. It is related from Ibn 'Umar that when the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out on the day of the *'Id*, he ordered
a spear to be placed in front of him and prayed towards it with the people
behind him. He used to do that on journeys. The amirs adopted this practice
from that time.

473. It is related from 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa, "I heard my father say that
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led them in prayer
at al-Batha' with a short spear in front of him - two *rak'ats* for
*Dhuhr* and two *rak'ats* for *'Asr*. Women and donkeys passed
in front of him.

**II: What should be the distance between the person praying and the
*sutra***

474. It is related that Sahl said, "Between the place where the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed and the wall there
was room for a sheep to walk past."

475. It is related that Salama said, "There was just room for a sheep to
pass between the wall of the mosque and the minbar."

**III: Praying facing a spear**

476. It is related from 'Abdullah that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to have a spear set up for him and would pray facing
it.

**IV: Praying facing a short spear**

477. It is related that 'Awn ibn Abi Juhayfa said, "I heard my father say,
'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out
to us at midday and was brought *wudu'* water and did *wudu*'.
Then he led us in the *Dhuhr* and *'Asr* prayers with a short spear
in set up front of him. Women and donkeys were passing behind it.'"

478. It is was related that Anas ibn Malik was heard to say, "When the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to relieve himself, I and
a boy followed him. We had a staff, a stick or a short spear and a water
container. When he finished relieving himself, we gave him the container."

**V: The *sutra* in Makka and elsewhere**

479. It is related that Abu Juhayfa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, came out to us at midday and prayed two
*rak'ats* for *Dhuhr* and two *rak'ats* for *'Asr* at
al-Batha' with a shor spear set up in front of him. He did *wudu'* and
the people rubbed themselves with his *wudu'* water.

**VI: Praying facing a pillar**

'Umar said, "Those who are praying are more entitled to the pillars than
those conversing." 'Umar saw a man praying between two pillars and moved
him up to a pillar and said, "Pray towards it."

480. It is related that Yazid ibn 'Ubayd said, "I used to come with Salama
ibn al-Akwa' and he would pray behind the pillar where the Qur'an was kept.
I said, 'Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar.' He
said, 'I saw that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was
keen to pray there.'"

481. It is related that Anas said, "I saw the greatest of the Companions
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hurrying to the
pillars at *Maghrib*."

Shu'ba added (in his variant from Anas), "until the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out."

**VII: Praying between the pillars outside the group prayer**

482. It is related that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, entered the House with Usama ibn Zayd, 'Uthman ibn Talha
and Bilal. He stayed there a long time and then came out. I was the first
person to enter after him and I asked Bilal where he had prayed. He said,
'Between the two front pillars.'"

483. It is related from Ibn 'Umar, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, entered the Ka'ba with Usama ibn Zayd, 'Uthman ibn Talha
and Bilal, closed the door and remained there for a while. When he came out,
I asked Bilal, 'What did the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
do?' He said, 'He placed himself with one pillar to his left and one to his
right and three pillars behind him (At that time, the House had six pillars
supporting it) and then he prayed.'"

Malik related that there were two pillars to his right.

484. It is related from Nafi' that whenever 'Abdullah entered the Ka'ba,
he would walk straight ahead when he entered, with the door directly behind
him. He walked on until there was about three cubits between him and the
wall in front of him where he prayed, seeking the place where Bilal told
him that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had prayed.
He said, "There is no harm in anyone praying in any part of the House he
likes."

**VIII: Praying towards a she-camel, any other camel, a tree or a
saddle-bag**

485. 'Ubaydullah related from Nafi' that Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to make his she-camel sit sideways and he would
pray towards it." ['Ubaydullah said,] "I asked, 'What would happen if the camel was startled?'
He answered, 'He would take the saddle, set it up and pray towards its end of
it (or he said "its back").' Ibn 'Umar used to do that."

**IX: Praying towards a bed**

486. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Do you equate us with dogs and donkeys?
I once found myself lying on the bed when the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came, faced the middle of the bed and started praying.
I disliked being in front of him, so I eased myself down towards the foot
of the bed until I had slipped out from under my bedcover."

**X: A person praying should push away someone who tries to pass in front
of him**

Ibn 'Umar pushed someone away while doing the *tashahhud* in the Ka'ba.
He said, "If he will not stop without your using force, then use force."

It is related that Abu Sa'id said that the Prophet said: [the next hadith].

[487](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t36). It is related that Abu Salih as-Samman said,
"I saw Abu Sa'id al-Khudri praying on the day of *Jumu'a* towards something
which was acting as *sutra* for him. A young man from the Banu Mu'ayt
wanted to pass directly in front of him. Abu Sa'id pushed him in the chest.
The young man looked round but saw no other way to go except in front of
him. So he tried to pass again and Abu Sa'id pushed him harder than the first
time. So he insulted Abu Sa'id and then went to Marwan and complained to
him about what Abu Sa'id had done to him. Abu Sa'id came in behind him into
the presence of Marwan who said, 'Abu Sa'id, what is this going on between
you and your nephew?' He said, 'I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, "When one of you is praying towards something using
it as a *sutra* and someone tries to pass directly in front of him,
he should push him away. If he persists, use force for he is nothing but
a shaytan."'"

**XI: The wrong action of someone who passes in front of somebody else
praying**

[488](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t37). It is related from Busr ibn Sa'id that Zayd
ibn Khalid sent him to Abu Juhaym to ask him what he had heard from the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about someone passing
in front of somebody else praying. Abu Juhaym said that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had said, "If the person
passing in front of a man praying knew what he was incurring, he would find
it preferable to wait forty rather than pass in front of him."

Abu'n-Nadr said, "I do not know whether he said forty days, months or years."

**XII: A man facing his companion or someone else in his prayer while he
is performing the prayer**

'Uthman disliked facing another man when he was praying if that distracted
him. However, if he is not distracted by it, Zayd ibn Thabit said, "It does
not matter. The man does not invalidate the other man's prayer."

489. It is related from 'A'isha that things which invalidate the prayer were
mentioned in her presence. They said, "It is invalidated by dogs, donkeys
and women." She said, "You have made us into dogs. I saw the Prophet, peace
be upon him, praying with me between him and the *qibla* lying on the
bed. I needed something and I disliked being in front of him, so I slipped
away."

Something similar is related from 'A'isha by a different *isnad*.

**XIII: Praying behind someone who is asleep**

490. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray when I was lying asleep on his bed. When he
wanted to perform the *witr*, he would wake me up and I would perform the *witr*
as well."

**XIV: Supererogatory prayers behind a woman**

491. It is related that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, said, "I used to
sleep in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, with my feet in his *qibla*. When he prostrated, he nudged me
and I pulled my legs up. When he stood up, I stretched them out again." She
said, "At that time, the houses did not have any lamps in them."

**XV: Someone who said, "Nothing invalidates the prayer."**

492. It is related that the things which invalidate the prayer were mentioned
in the presence of 'A'isha, and they were dogs, donkeys and women. She said,
"You have likened us to donkeys and dogs. By Allah, I saw the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, praying with me lying on the bed between
him and the *qibla*. I needed to relieve myself, and not wanting 
to sit up and annoy the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
I slipped out next to his feet."

493. It is related that the nephew of Ibn Shihab said that he asked his uncle
about what invalidates the prayer and he said, "Nothing invalidates it. 'Urwa
ibn az-Zubayr reported to me that 'A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to get up at night and pray with me in between
him and the *qibla* on the conjugal bed.'"

**XVI: A small girl being carried on the shoulders during the prayer**

[494](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t84). It is related from Abu Qatada al-Ansari
that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to pray carrying Umama, the daughter of Zaynab, the daughter of the Messenger
of Allah, and Abu'l-'As ibn Rabi'a ibn 'Abdu Shams. When he prostrated, he
put her down. When he stood up, he lifted her up again.

**XVII: Praying towards a bed with a menstruating woman in it**

495. It was related that Maymuna bint al-Harith said, "My bed was right next
to the place where the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
prayed and sometimes his garment fell on me while I was on my bed."

496. It is related that Maymuna was heard to say, "The Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray with me sleeping beside him.
When he prostrated, his garment touched me and I was menstruating."

Sulayman ash-Shaybani added, "and I was menstruating."

**XVIII: Is it permissible for a man to nudge his wife when going into
prostration so that he can prostrate properly?**

497. It is related that 'A'isha said, " It is very bad for you to equate us with dogs and donkeys! I once found myself lying between the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  and the qibla. When he wanted to prostrate, he nudged my legs and I pulled them up."

**XIX: A woman removing something harmful from a person praying**

498. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "Once while the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing in prayer at the Ka'ba,
there was a group of Quraysh sitting there and one of them said, 'Do you
not see this show-off? Which of you will go to so and so's butchered camel,
get hold of its innards, bring them and then, when he prostrates, put them
on his back?' The most wretched of them did it and when the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prostrated, he put them on
his back. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
remained in prostration and they laughed until they fell over one another
laughing. Someone went to Fatima, peace be upon her, who was a young girl
at the time. She came running. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, remained in prostration until she removed it from him. Then she
turned to them and cursed them. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, finished the prayer, he said, 'O Allah! Punish Quraysh!
O Allah, punish Quraysh! O Allah, punish Quraysh!' Then he named them: 'O
Allah, punish 'Amr ibn Hisham, 'Utba ibn Rabi'a, Shayba ibn Rabi'a, al-Walid
ibn 'Utba, Umayya ibn Khalaf, 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt, and 'Umara ibn al-Walid.'"

'Abdullah said, "By Allah, I saw them all lying dead on the day of Badr and
then they were dragged into the well of Badr and then the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The people of the well have
been pursued by the curse.'"

**Chapter 13. Book of the times
of the Prayer**

Allah's words, *"The prayer is prescribed for the believers at set times"*
(4:103) meaning He appointed times for them.

[499](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#1). It is related from Ibn Shihab that one day
'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz delayed the prayer. 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr went to him
and told him that one day in Iraq al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba had delayed the prayer
and Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari had gone to him and said, "What is this, Mughira?
Do you not know that Jibril descended and prayed and the Messenger of Allah.
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and
the Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed.
Then he prayed again and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed. Then he prayed again and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed.
Then he said, 'I was commanded to do this.'" 'Umar said to 'Urwa, "Know what
you are relating. Did Jibril definitely lead the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, at the time of the prayer?" 'Urwa replied,
"This is what Bashir ibn Abi Mas'ud related from his father." 'Urwa said,
"'A'isha related to me that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray *'Asr*while the sunlight was pouring into
her room, before the sun itself had become visible (i.e. because it was still
high in the sky)."

**I: *"Turning in repentance towards Him. Show fear of Him and establish
the prayer. Do not be among the idolaters."* (30:31)**

500. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "A delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays came
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said,
'We are from a particular branch of Rabi'a and we can only get to you during
the sacred months. Enjoin something on us so that we can take it from you
and summon to it those we left behind.' He said, 'I enjoin on you four things
and I forbid you four. Belief in Allah (which he explained to them was the
testimony that there is no god but Allah and that he was the Messenger of
Allah), the establishment of the prayer, the payment of *zakat* and
the submission to me of a fifth of any booty you take. I forbid you *dubba',
hantam, muqayyar* and *naqir* [different kinds of containers used
for making wine].'"

**II: The pledge of allegiance on the basis of establishing the prayer**

501. It is related that Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said, "I pledged my allegiance
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on the
basis of establishing the prayer, paying *zakat* and giving good counsel
to every Muslim."

**III: Prayer is expiation**

502. It is related that Hudhayfa was heard to say, "We were sitting with
'Umar who said, 'Does anyone amongst you remember what the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said about trial and tribulation
(*fitna*)?' I spoke up, 'I do, exactly as he said it.' He asked, 'You
are bold enough for it.' I said, 'The trial (*fitna*) of a man in respect
of his wife, wealth, children and neighbours is expiated by prayer, fasting,
*sadaqa*, and by commanding what is right and forbidding what is wrong.'
He said, 'That is not what I meant, but rather the tribulation which spreads
like the waves of the sea.' Hudhayfa said, 'You have nothing to fear from
it, Amir al-Mu'minin! There is a closed door between you and it.' He said,
'Will it be broken down or opened?' Hudhayfa replied, 'It will be broken
down.' He said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' We said, 'Did 'Umar
know what the door was?' Hudhayfa said, 'Yes, as surely as night follows
day. I related to him a *hadith* without any mistakes in it."

Shaqiq said, "We were afraid to ask Hudhayfa and told Masruq and he asked
him. Hudhayfa said, "The door was 'Umar."

503. It is related from Ibn Mas'ud that a man received a kiss from a woman
and went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told
him about it. Allah sent down, *"Perform the prayer at the ends of the
days and the early part of the night. Good actions remove bad actions."*
(11:114) The man asked, "Messenger of Allah, is this for me?" He said, "It
is for every single one of my community."

[The man was Abu'l-Yasar Ka'b ibn 'Amr al-Ansari.]

**IV: The excellence of doing the prayer at its proper time**

504. It is related that Abu 'Amr ash-Shaybani said, "The owner of this house
(and he indicated the house of 'Abdullah) said, 'I asked the Prophet what
action was most loved by Allah and he said, "The prayer at its proper time."'
" 'Abdullah asked, "Then what?" He said, "Then devotion to parents." He said,
"Then what?" He said, "Jihad in the way of Allah."

He said, "He related them to me and if I had asked for more, he would have
told me more."

**V: The five prayers are expiation**

[505](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t94). It is related from Abu Hurayra that he heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "What
do you think would happen if there was a river by someone's door in which
he washed five times every day? Do you think that any dirt would remain on
him?" They said, "Not a scrap of dirt would remain on him." He said, "That
is a metaphor of the five prayers by which Allah wipes out wrong actions."

**VI: Delaying the prayer beyond its proper time**

506. It is related that Anas said, "I no longer recognise anything of what went
on in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."
He was asked, "What about the prayer?" He said, "Have you not done to the
prayer what you have done to it?"

507. It is related that az-Zuhri was heard to say, "I came to Anas ibn Malik
in Damascus and found him weeping. I asked, 'Why are you weeping?' He said, 'I
no longer recognise anything of what I knew except for this prayer, and even
it has been delayed [past its time].'"

Something like it is related from 'Uthman ibn Abi Rawwad.

**VII: The person praying is in close conversation with his Lord, the Mighty
and Exalted**

508. It is related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "When one of you prays, he is in close conversation
with his Lord, so he should not spit to his right, but under his left foot."

Qatada said, "He should not spit in front of him or ahead, but to his left
or under his feet."

Shu'ba said, "He should not spit in front of him or to his right, but to
his left or under his foot."

It is related that Anas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "He should not spit towards the qibla or to his right, but
to his left or under his foot."

509. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Be correct in the prostration and do not spread your forearms
like a dog does. When someone spits, he should not spit in front of him or
to his right. He is in close conversation with his Lord."

**VIII: Waiting until it is cooler to pray *Dhuhr* when it is very
hot**

[510](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#29). It is related from Abu Hurayra and 'Abdullah
ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "'Scorching heat is from the blast of Jahannam. So, when the
heat is fierce, delay the prayer until it gets cooler.'"

511. It is related that Abu Dharr said, "The *mu'adhdhin* of the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called *Dhuhr* and the Prophet
said, 'Let it get cooler. Let it get cooler,' or he said, 'Wait, wait.' He
said, 'Intense heat is from the blast of Jahannam. When it is very hot, delay
the prayer until it gets cooler and we can see the shadows of the hills.'"

[512](http://bewley.virtualave.net/bukhari6.html#28). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "When the heat is
fierce, delay the prayer until it gets cooler, for scorching heat is from
the blast of Jahannam." The Fire complained to its Lord, 'O Lord, part of
me consumes the other part.' So He gave it permission to breathe out twice
- one breath in the winter and one in the summer. The breath in the summer
is the most intense heat you feel and the breath in the winter, the most
intense cold you feel."

513. It is related from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said: "Wait until it is cooler for
*Dhuhr*. Intense heat is from the blast of Jahannam."

Sufyan, Yahya and Abu 'Awana corroborated it from al-A'mash.

**IX: Delaying *Dhuhr* until it gets cooler when on a journey**

514. It is related that Abu Dharr al-Ghifari said, "We were with the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and the
mu'*adhdhin* wanted to call the *adhan* for *Dhuhr* but the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Let it get cooler.'
Then he once more wanted to call the *adhan* but he said to him, 'Let
it get cooler until we can see the shadows of the hills.' The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Intense heat is from the blast
of Jahannam. When it is very hot, delay the prayer until it gets cooler.'"

**X: The time of *Dhuhr* is when the sun begins to decline**

Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
pray at midday."

515. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went out when the sun began to decline and
prayed *Dhuhr*. Then he stood on the minbar and spoke of the Final Hour
and said that there would be momentous things in it. Then he said, "Whoever
wants to ask about something should do so. I will tell you about anything
you ask me as long as I am in this place." Most of the people began to weep
and he repeated several times, "Ask me." 'Abdullah ibn Hudhafa as-Sahmi stood
up and asked, "Who is my father?" He said, "Your father is Hudhafa." Then
he again repeated several times, "Ask me." Then 'Umar knelt and said, "We
are pleased with Allah as a Lord, with Islam as a deen and with Muhammad
as a Prophet." He was silent and then said, "The Garden and the Fire were
displayed before me just now against this wall and I have never seen such
good and such evil."

516. It is related from Abu Barza, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to pray *Subh* when it was possible for someone
to recognise the person sitting next to him. In it he would recite between
sixty and a hundred *ayats*. He would pray *Dhuhr* when the sun
began to decline and *'Asr* at a time when it would still be possible
to go to the furthest part of Madina and back with the sun still white."
Abu'l-Minhal said, "I forgot what he said about *Maghrib*." "He did
not mind delaying *'Isha'* until one third of the night had passed."
Then he said, "Until half of the night had passed."

Shu'ba said, "I met him one time and he said, 'Or a third of the night.'"

517. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "When we were praying behind
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for
*Dhuhr*, we would prostrate on our clothes to protect ourselves from
the heat."

**XI: Delaying *Dhuhr* until *'Asr***

518. It is related from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, prayed seven and eight *rak'ats* for *Dhuhr*,
*'Asr*, and *Maghrib* and *'Isha'* respectively.* Ayyub said,
"Perhaps that was on rainy nights." Jabir [who transmitted from Ibn 'Abbas] said, "Perhaps."

[*Meaning that he joined the prayers.]

**XII: The time of 'Asr**

Hisham said, "inside her room" (referring to 'A'isha)

519. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, prayed *'Asr* when the sun had not yet
left her room."

520. It is related that 'A'isha said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray *'Asr* when the sun was
still in her room and the shade had not appeared in it.

521. It is related that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to pray *'Asr* when the sun was
still in my room and the shade had not yet appeared."

Malik, Yahya ibn Sa'id, Shu'ayb and Ibn Abi Hafsa said, "Before the sun was
high."

522. It is related that Sayyar ibn Salama said, "My father and I came to
Abu Barza al-Aslami and my father said to him, 'When did the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, pray the obligatory prayers.'
He said, 'He used to pray the midday prayer, which you call the first, when
the sun began to decline. He prayed *'Asr* at a time when one of us
could return to his house at the furthest part of the city and the sun would
still be still white. (I forgot what he said about *Maghrib*.) The Prophet
preferred to delay the *'Isha'* prayer which you cal*l al-'Atama*.
He did not like sleeping before it or conversation after it. He used to leave
from the morning prayer when a man could recognise the person sitting next
to him and he would recite between sixty and a hundred *ayats*."

[523](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#10). It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We
used to pray the *'Asr* prayer and then if one of us went out to the
Banu 'Amr ibn 'Awf, we would find them praying *'Asr.*"

524. It is related that Abu Umama was heard to say, "We prayed *Dhuhr*
with 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz. Then we went out and came to Anas ibn Malik
and found him praying *'Asr* . I said, 'Uncle, which prayer is this you
have just prayed?' He answered, '*'Asr*, and this is the prayer of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which we used to pray
with him [i.e. at this time].'"

525. It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray *'Asr* when the sun
was high and white. Someone could go to the 'Awali towns and reach them while the
sun was still high. Some of the 'Awali towns were located about four miles or so from Madina."

[526](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#11). It is related that Anas ibn Malik said, "We
used to pray *'Asr* and then it was still possible for one of us to
go to Quba' and reach there while the sun was still high."

**XIII: The wrong action of someone who misses *'Asr***

[527](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#21). It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone misses
the prayer of *'Asr* is as if he had been deprived of his family and
all his property."

**XIV: Someone who fails to pray *'Asr***

528. It is related that Abu'l-Malih said, "We were on an expedition with
Burayda on a cloudy day and he said, 'Perform the *'Asr* prayer well inside the time.
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone fails to pray
 the *'Asr*  prayer, his actions will come to nothing."'"

**XV: The excellence of the *'Asr*  prayer**

529. It is related that Jarir said, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, one night and he looked at the full moon and
said, 'You will see your Lord as you see this moon and you will not be harmed
by seeing Him. If you can manage not to be overwhelmed to the point of missing
the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets, then do not be.' Then he
recited, *'And glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the
sun and before its setting.'* (50:39)"

Isma'il said, "Do not let that happen and do not miss it."

[530](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw3.html#t85). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "There
are angels which take turns in being with you in the night and other angels
in the day and they meet together at the prayers of *Fajr* and
*'Asr*. Then the ones who were with you during the night ascend and
Allah asks them - although He knows better than they do - 'How were My slaves
when you left them?' They say, 'When we left them they were praying and when
we came to them, they were praying.'"

**XVI: The one who gets in on*e rak'at* of *'Asr* before sunset**

531. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When any you get in one prostration
of the *'Asr* prayer before the sun sets, you should complete your prayer.
When you get in a prostration of the *Subh* prayer before the sun rises,
you should complete your prayer."

532. It is related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah that his father told him that
he heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, "Your time as compared to the communities before you is like the time
between the *'Asr* prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were given
the Torah and acted by it until the middle of the day and then gave up. They
were given a qirat each. Then the people of the Evangel were given the Evangel
and acted by it until the *'Asr* prayer and then gave up. They were
given a qirat each. Then we were given the Qur'an and acted (by it) until
sunset and we were given two qirats each. The people of both the Books said,
'Our Lord! You have them two *qirats* each and you only gave us one
even though we did more.' Allah said, 'Have I been unjust to you in any way
with regard to your reward?' They said, 'No.' He said, 'It is my favour which
I give to whomever I wish.'"

533. It is related from Abu Musa from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "The metaphor of the Muslims, the Jews and the Christians
is that of a man who hires some people to work for him until nightfall. They
work until the middle of the day and say, 'We do not need a wage from you.' So he
hires others and says, 'Finish off the rest of the day and you will receive
what I stipulated.' They work until the time of the *'Asr* prayer and
say, 'You can have whatever we have done.' So he hires some other people
and they work the rest of the day until sunset and get all the pay of the
first two groups.'"

**XVII: The time of *Maghrib***

'Ata' said, "A sick person can pray *Maghrib* and *'Isha'* together."

534. It is related that Rafi' ibn Khadij said, "When we left after praying
*Maghrib* with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
it was still possible for a man to see the places where his arrows hit ."

535. Muhammad ibn 'Amr ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Ali said that al-Hajjaj* came and we questioned Jabir ibn 'Abdullah who replied, "The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray *Dhuhr*
at midday, *'Asr* when the sun was still white and *Maghrib* the
moment it became due but he would vary the time of *'Isha'*. When he
found the people gathered, he would pray earlier. and when he found them
taking their time, he would delay it. They (or the Prophet) used to pray
*Subh* when it was still dark."

- Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf was the governor was Madina for Marwan after az-Zubayr was killed. He used to delay the prayer.

536. It is related that Salama said, "We used to pray

*Maghrib*

with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when the sun became
concealed by the veil (the horizon)."

537. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, prayed seven *rak'ats* together and eight
*rak'ats* together."

**XVIII: Dislike of calling *Maghrib 'Isha'***

538. It is related from 'Abdullah al-Muzani that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Do not let the Bedouins persuade you concerning
the name of your *Maghrib* prayer " He said, "The Bedouins say its name
is *'Isha'*."

**XIX: *'Isha'* and *'Atama*, and those who think both names
permitted**

Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, "The most difficult prayers for the hypocrites are
*'Isha'* and *Fajr*." And he said "If they only knew what *'Atama*
and *Fajr* contain."

Abu 'Abdullah said, "It is best to call it *'Isha'*, going by the words
of Allah*, 'and after the 'Isha' prayer.'* (24:58)"

It is mentioned that Abu Musa said, "We used to take turns in attending the
prayer of *'Isha*' with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and then he made it later (*a'tama biha*)."

Ibn 'Abbas and 'A'isha said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, delayed *(a'tama*) the *'Isha'* prayer."

Someone said that 'A'isha said,"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, delayed *(a'tama*) *al-'Atama*."

Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to
pray *'Isha'*."

Abu Barza said,"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to delay *'Isha'*."

him and grant him peace, prayed *Maghrib* and *'Isha'*."

539. It is related that 'Abdullah said, "One night the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, led us in the prayer of *'Isha'*,
which is the one which people call *al-'Atama*, and when he finished,
he turned to us and said, 'Do you see this night? No one on the surface of
the earth will still be there in a hundred years from now.'"

**XX: The time of *'Isha'* when people gather or are late**

540. Jabir ibn 'Abdullah was asked about the prayer of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to pray *Dhuhr* at midday, *'Asr* when
the sun was still white and *Maghrib* the moment it became due. When
there were many people, he would pray *'Isha'* earlier. and when they
were few, he would delay it. He used to pray *Subh* when it was still
dark."

**XXI: The excellence of *'Isha'***

541. It is related that 'A'isha said, "One night, before the spread of Islam,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, delayed
*'Isha*'. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not
come out until 'Umar said, 'The women and children have gone to sleep.' Then
he came out and said to the people in the mosque, 'No people on earth would
have waited for it except you.'"

542. It is related that Abu Musa said, "I and my companions who came with
me in the boat disembarked at Baqi' Buthan, the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, then being in Madina. A group of us used to take
turns in attending the prayer of *'Isha'* with the Prophet every night.
One night my companions and I found him busy on some matter and he delayed
the prayer until the middle of the night. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came out and led the prayer. When he finished the
prayer, he said to those who were present, 'Go and rejoice in the blessing
of Allah on you. No other people but you have prayed at this hour.' Or he
said, 'Nobody but you has prayed at this hour.' I do not know which of the
two he said."

Abu Musa said, "We returned and were delighted by what we had heard from
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."

**XXII: The undesirability of sleep before *'Isha'***

543. It is related from Abu Barza that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, disliked sleeping before *'Isha'* and
conversation after it.

**XXIII: Sleeping before *'Isha'* for those who are overcome by sleep**

544. It is related from 'Urwa that 'A'isha said, "One night the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, delayed *'Isha'* until
'Umar called out, 'The prayer! The women and children have gone to sleep.'
He came out and said, 'No people on the earth would have waited for it except
you.'" 'Urwa said, "In those days, the prayer was done only [in congregation] in Madina. They
used to pray between the disappearance of the redness of sunset up until
the end of the first third of the night."

545. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "One night the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was kept from us by some
business and delayed the prayer to the point that we went to sleep in the
mosque and then woke up and then went to sleep and woke up again. Then the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came out to us and then
said, "No people on the earth would have waited for the prayer except you.'"
Ibn 'Umar did not mind advancing or delaying the prayer when he was not afraid
that sleep would overcome him and keep him from praying it in its time. He
used to lie down before it.

Ibn Jurayj said, "I spoke to 'Ata' and he said, 'I heard Ibn 'Abbas, say,
"One night the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
delayed *'Isha'* until the people had gone to sleep and woken up, and
then gone to sleep and woken up again. 'Umar got up and said, "The prayer!"'
'Ata' said that Ibn 'Abbas said, 'The Prophet of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, came out - and it is as if I could see him now -
with water dripping from his head, and, placing his hand on his head, he
said, "If it were not hard for my community, I would have commanded them
to pray it at this time."' I asked 'Ata' to confirm how the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, had placed his hand on his head as he
had been told by Ibn 'Abbas. 'Ata' separated his fingers slightly for me
and then placed the tips of his fingers on the side of his head with his
thumb touching the top of his ear by his face between the temple and the
top of the beard. He did it neither slowly nor quickly but like that. He
said, 'If it were not hard for my community, I would have commanded them
to pray at this time.'"

**XXIV CHAPTER: The time of *'Isha'* extends up until the middle of
the night**

Abu Barza said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used
to prefer to delay it."

546. It is related that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, delayed the *'Isha'* prayer until the middle
of the night and then prayed. Then he said, 'Most people have prayed and
gone to sleep, but you were in prayer the whole time you were waiting for
it.'"

Anas was heard to add, "It is as if I could see the white glint of his ring
on that day."

**XXV: The excellence of the *Fajr* Prayer**

547. Qays related: Jarir said to me, "We were with the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace,  on the night of the full moon, and he looked at the moon and said, 'You will see your Lord as you see this [moon] and you will not be harmed by seeing Him (or you will not doubt seeing Him). If you can manage not to be overwhelmed to the point of missing the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets, then do not be.' Then he recited, *'And glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting.'* (50:39)"

548. It is related from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Musa from his ather that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever prays the two cool
ones* will enter the Garden."

[* The Fajr prayer and the 'Asr prayer.]

549. This is related from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdullah ibn Qays.

Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdullah related the same thing from the Prophet.

**XXVI: The time of *Fajr***

550. It is related that Zayd ibn Thabit said that they used to have suhur
with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and then stood
up for the prayer. Anas said, "I asked how long it was between them and he
said, 'Enough for fifty or sixty *ayats*.'"

551. It is related from Anas ibn Malik that the Prophet of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and Zayd ibn Thabit had *sahur* together
and after they finished their *sahur* the Prophet of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, stood up and prayed. Anas was asked how long
it was between finishing their *sahur* and starting the prayer, and
said, "Enough time for a man to recite fifty *ayats*."

552. It is related that Sahl ibn Sa'd said, "I used to have *sahur*
with my family and then hurry to catch the *Fajr* prayer with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace."

[553](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#4). It is related from 'Urwa ibn az-Zubayr
that 'A'isha reported, "The believing women used to attend the *Fajr*
prayer with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
wrapped up in their garments and then return to their houses when they finished
the prayer and no one could recognise them because of how dark it was."

**XXVII: The one who gets in one *rak'at* of *Fajr***

[554](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#5). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ""Whoever manages
to perform a *rak'at* of *Subh* before the sun has risen has done
*Subh* in time, and whoever manages to perform a rak'at of '*Asr*
before the sun has set has done *'Asr* in time.".

**XXVIII: The one who catches one *rak'at* of the prayer**

[555](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw1.html#15). It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Whoever catches
one *rak'at* of the prayer has caught the prayer."

**XXIX: Praying between *Fajr* and sunrise**

556. It is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, "Some reliable men, the most reliable
of whom I consider to be 'Umar, said that the Prophet forbade praying after
*Subh* until the sun had risen and after *'Asr* until the sun had
set."

557. Ibn 'Abbas said, "Some people told me this."(556).

[558](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw4.html#qu45). It is related that Ibn 'Umar said that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do
not seek to pray when the sun is rising nor when it is setting."

Ibn 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "When the edge of the sun comes up, delay the prayer until
it has risen. When the edge of the sun goes down, then delay the prayer until
it has set.

'Abda corroborated it.

559. It is related from Abu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade two kinds of sales, two ways of dressing
and two prayers. He forbade praying after *Fajr* until the sun had risen
and after *'Asr* until the sun had set, and wrapping oneself in a garment
so that the arms are not free and sitting wrapped in a single garment in
a way that exposes the private parts to the sky, and the sales called
*munabadha* and *mulamasa*.

**XXX: One should not seek to pray just before sunset**

[560](http://bewley.virtualave.net/muw4.html#qu47). It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "None of you should
seek to pray as the sun is rising or as it is setting."

of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'There is no prayer
after *Subh* until the sun rises and there is no prayer after *'Asr*
until the sun sets.'"

562. It is related that Mu'awiya said, "You pray a prayer which we, who
accompanied the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
never saw him pray and indeed he prohibited it. I mean the two rak'ats after
*'Asr.*"

563. It is related that Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, forbade two prayers: after *Fajr* until
the sun rises and after *'Asr* until the sun sets."

**XXXI: Those who did not dislike doing the prayer at any time except after
*'Asr* and *Fajr*.**

'Umar, Ibn 'Umar, Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurayra related it.

564. Ibn 'Umar said, "I pray as I saw my companions praying. I do not forbid
anyone from praying at any time during the night or day he wishes as long
as they do not seek to pray at sunrise or sunset."

**XXXII: Praying missed prayers and suchlike after *'Asr.***

It is related from Umm Salama that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, prayed two *rak'ats* after *'Asr* and said, "Some people
from the 'Abdu'l-Qays kept me too busy to pray the two *rak'ats* after
*Dhuhr*."

565. It is related that 'A'isha was heard to say, "By the One who took him
away, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never left off
doing them until he met Allah and he did not meet Allah until the prayer
had become difficult for him. He used to pray many of his prayers sitting
down (meaning the two *rak'ats* after *'Asr*). The Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to pray them, but he did not pray
them in the mosque, fearing that it would be difficult for his community.
He liked to make things easy for them."

566. It is related from Hisham that his father said that 'A'isha said, "Nephew,
the Prophet never omitted the two prostrations afte*r 'Asr* in my room."

567. It is related that 'A'isha said, "There were two *rak'ats* that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never left
out, either openly or secretly - the two *rak'ats* before *Subh*
and the two *rak'ats* afte*r 'Asr*."

568. It is related that 'A'isha said, "Whenever the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, came to me in the day after *'Asr* he prayed
two *rak'ats*."

**XXXIII: Praying well in time on a cloudy day.**

569. It is related that Abu'l-Malih said, "We were with Burayda on a cloudy
day and he said, 'Do the prayer well in time for the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone leaves out the prayer of
*'Asr*, his actions will come to nothing."'"

**XXXIV: Giving the *adhan* after the time has gone**

570. It is related that Abu Qatada said, "One night we were travelling with
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and one of the people
said, 'I wish that you would let us rest, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'I
am afraid that you might sleep past the prayer.' Bilal said, 'I will wake
you up.' They lay down and Bilal put his back against his saddle and his
eyes became heavy and he fell asleep. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, woke up when the edge of the sun had already appeared and
said, 'Bilal, what about what you said!' He said, 'I have never had such
a sleep.' He said, 'Allah takes your souls when He wishes and returns them
to you when He wishes. Bilal, get up and call the people to prayer.' Then
he did w*udu'* and when the sun had risen and become white, he stood up and
prayed."

**XXXV: Leading people in a group prayer after the time has gone**

571. It is related from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab came
on the Day of the Ditch after the sun had set and he began to curse the
unbelievers of Quraysh and said, 'Messenger of Allah, I was about to pray
*'Asr* when the sun set.' The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'By Allah, I have not prayed either!' We got up and went
to Buthan and he did *wudu'* for the prayer and so did we. He prayed
*'Asr* after the sun had set and then prayed *Maghrib* after it."

**XXXVI: The one who forgets a prayer should pray it when he remembers it
and should only repeat that prayer**

Ibrahim said, "If someone omitted a single prayer twenty years ago, he should
only repeat that single prayer."

572. It is related from Anas that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Anyone who forgets a prayer should pray it when he remembers
it and that is the only expiation he has to do for it. *'Establish the
prayer for My remembrance.'*"

Musa said that Hammam said, ÒI heard him say later, Ò'Establish the prayer for My remembrance.'Ó

Anas related something like it from the Prophet (by a slightly different
*isnad*.)

**XXXVII: Making up prayers is done in order**

573. It is related that Jabir said, "On the Day of the Ditch, 'Umar began
to curse their unbelievers and said, 'I was about to pray *'Asr* when
the sun set. We went down to Buthan and prayed after the sun had set and
then played *Maghrib*."

**XXXVIII: The undesirability of night-talk (*samar*) after
*'Isha'***

574.It is related that Abu'l-Minhal said, "I went to Abu Barza al-Aslami
with my father who said to him, 'Tell us how the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed the obligatory prayers.' He said, 'He would pray *Zuhr*, which is what you call the first, when the sun began to decline. He would pray *'Asr* at a time when it would still be possible for one of us to go to his family in the furthest part of Madina and back with the sun still white.' I forgot what he said about al-'Atama (*'Isha'*). He said, ÒHe [the Prophet] used to recommend delaying *'Isha'*.Ó He said, ÒHe [the Prophet] disliked going to sleep before it (*'Isha'*) and conversing after it. He used to perform supererogatory prayers after the morning prayer until one of us could recognize the one sitting beside him. He would recite between sixty and a hundred Ü*ayat*s.Ó

**XXXIX: Talking about *fiqh* and other excellent things during the
night after *'Isha'***

575. It is related that Qurra ibn Khalid said, "We waited for al-Hasan and
he was late coming to us until it was near to the time he usually got up.
Then he came and said, 'Some neighbours of ours invited us.' Then he said,
'Anas said, "One night we waited for the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, until it was half-way through the night. He came and led
the prayer and then addressed us saying, 'Most people have prayed and then
gone to sleep but you were in prayer the whole time you were waiting for
the prayer.'"' Al-Hasan said, 'People are continuously in good action the
whole time they are waiting to do a good action.'"

Qurra said that that was part of the hadith of Anas from the Prophet.

576. It is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, "Towards the end of his
life the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed the *'Isha'*
prayer and when he had said the salam, the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, stood up and said, 'Do you see this night? No one on
the surface of the earth today will still be there in a hundred years from
now.' The people misunderstood what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon
him, had said so that they began to invent tales about what would be happening
in a hundred years time. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, 'No one on the surface of the earth today will still be there,' meaning
by that that generation would have passed away."

**XL: Night-talk with the family and guests**

577. It is related from 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr that the People of the
*Suffa* were poor people and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, 'Whoever has food for two should invite a third. If he has
enough for four, he should invite a fifth or a sixth.' Abu Bakr took three
and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, took ten. There
was me and my father and mother (The narrator said, "I do not know if he
said, 'My wife and our servant who was shared between us and Abu Bakr's house.')
Abu Bakr went to eat with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and stayed until *'Isha'* was prayed and then went back again
and stayed until the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
eaten. Then Abu Bakr came after as much of the night had passed as Allah
willed and his wife said to him, 'What kept you from your guests?' - or she
said, 'your guest.' He said, 'Haven't you given them their meal?' She said,
'They refused until you came. They were offered food and they refused.' I
went away and hid. Abu Bakr called out, 'O Ghunthar!' and derided me and
abused me. Then he said, 'Eat and may you have no welcome,' adding, 'By Allah,
I will never eat it!' By Allah, with every mouthful of it we took, more appeared
underneath - until they were full and there was more food than there had
been before. Abu Bakr looked at it and there was as much as there had been
or more and he said to his wife, 'Sister of the Banu Firas! What is this?'
She said, 'No, apple of my eye, there is now three times as much as there
was before.' So Abu Bakr ate from it and said, 'That was from Shaytan,' meaning
his oath. Then he ate a mouthful of it and took the dish to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it remained with him until the
morning. There had been a treaty between us and some people and it had come
to an end, so he divided us up into twelve men, each of whom had a group
with him - only Allah knows how many there were with each man - and everyone
of them ate from it." Or as he said.
